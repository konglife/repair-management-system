# Story 1.4: Main Application Layout Implementation

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** a consistent and responsive navigation system across all pages,
**so that** I can easily access different sections of the repair management system on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The user sees a permanent sidebar navigation on desktop screens (≥768px)
2. The user sees a hamburger menu on mobile screens (<768px) that opens a sliding sidebar
3. The navigation includes 5 main sections: Dashboard, Stock, Sales, Repairs, and Customers
4. Each navigation item has an appropriate icon and shows the current active page
5. The user can access their profile and sign out through an integrated user button
6. The layout is fully accessible with proper screen reader support
7. All UI components use the Shadcn/ui design system for consistency

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Context
This story implements the foundational layout system that was planned in the architecture documentation but needed to be built as a separate implementation phase after the initial project setup (Stories 1.1-1.3).

### Technical Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/12-layout-system.md]
The layout system follows a three-tier component architecture:
- **MainLayout**: Root wrapper with responsive grid and state management
- **Sidebar**: Navigation component with active route highlighting
- **Header**: Top bar with mobile controls and user management

### Component Structure
```
src/components/layout/
├── main-layout.tsx     # Root layout wrapper
├── sidebar.tsx         # Navigation sidebar
└── header.tsx          # Top navigation bar
```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md]
- **Desktop (≥768px)**: Permanent 256px sidebar with two-column layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Hidden sidebar with Sheet-based overlay navigation
- **Breakpoint**: Uses Tailwind's `md:` breakpoint for consistency

#### Design System Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack-updated-versions-august-2025.md]
- **Shadcn/ui**: All UI components use the established design system
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent iconography throughout navigation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance through Radix UI primitives

#### Authentication Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
- **Route Protection**: Implemented at route group level (`src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`)
- **User Management**: Clerk UserButton integration in header
- **Loading States**: Proper handling during authentication verification

### Navigation Structure
```typescript
const navigationItems = [
  { name: "Dashboard", href: "/dashboard", icon: LayoutDashboard },
  { name: "Stock", href: "/stock", icon: Boxes },
  { name: "Sales", href: "/sales", icon: ShoppingCart },
  { name: "Repairs", href: "/repairs", icon: Wrench },
  { name: "Customers", href: "/customers", icon: Users },
];
```

### Mobile Navigation Implementation
[Source: docs/components/layout-components.md]
- **Sheet Component**: Accessible overlay with proper ARIA labels
- **State Management**: React useState for sidebar visibility
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for accessibility compliance
- **Animations**: Smooth slide-in transitions

## Testing

### Accessibility Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
- **Screen Reader Support**: Tested with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility verified
- **WCAG Compliance**: AA level compliance achieved
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in mobile overlay

### Cross-Device Testing
- **Desktop**: Permanent sidebar functionality verified
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu and overlay navigation tested
- **Tablet**: Responsive breakpoint behavior confirmed
- **Touch Devices**: Touch target sizes validated

### Performance Testing
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with tree-shaken imports
- **Render Performance**: Minimal re-renders with efficient state management
- **Load Times**: Fast initial render with code splitting
