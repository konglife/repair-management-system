## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 4.1 completion notes]
- Sales infrastructure is fully established with working sale creation and history display
- Sale data model and Prisma schema are implemented with proper relationships to Customer and SaleItem models
- tRPC sale router exists at `src/server/api/routers/sale.ts` with create and getAll procedures
- Sales page exists at `src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx` with sales history table
- Sale model includes totalAmount and totalCost fields for revenue and profit calculations
- Testing patterns are established with Jest and React Testing Library for both router and UI components
- Build pipeline is clean with zero TypeScript errors and working sales functionality
- Sales history table is already implemented and needs enhancement with detail view links

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#sale + architecture/4-data-models.md#saleitem + Story 4.1 completion notes]

**Sale Model**: Main transaction record with established relationships
- `id: String` (unique CUID for detail page URL parameter - AC: 1)
- `customerId: String` (foreign key to Customer for name display - AC: 2) 
- `totalAmount: Float` (net total display - AC: 2)
- `totalCost: Float` (for gross profit calculation - AC: 4)
- `createdAt: DateTime` (sale date display - AC: 2)
- **Relationships**: One Sale belongs to one Customer, One Sale has many SaleItems

**SaleItem Model**: Individual line items in sale for detailed display
- `id: String` (unique CUID)
- `saleId: String` (foreign key to Sale)
- `productId: String` (foreign key to Product for name display - AC: 3)
- `quantity: Int` (quantity display in items table - AC: 3)
- `priceAtTime: Float` (price display in items table - AC: 3)
- `costAtTime: Float` (for profit calculations)
- **Relationships**: One SaleItem belongs to one Sale, One SaleItem references one Product

**Customer Model**: Existing model for customer information display
- `id: String` (relationship reference)
- `name: String` (customer name display - AC: 2)

**Product Model**: Existing model for product information in sale items
- `id: String` (relationship reference) 
- `name: String` (product name display in sale items table - AC: 3)

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#prisma-relationships + Story 4.1 implementation]
- **Prisma Query Operations**: Use `include: { customer: true, saleItems: { include: { product: true } } }` to fetch complete sale details in single query

    id: z.string().cuid("Invalid sale ID format")
  })
  ```
- **Query Logic**: Use Prisma include to fetch related data in single query:
  ```typescript
  include: {
    customer: true,
    saleItems: {
      include: {
        product: true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
