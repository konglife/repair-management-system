# Story 1.3: Protected Navigation & User Profile Display

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** logged-in User,
**I want** to see a main navigation menu (sidebar) and my user information,
**so that** I can access different parts of the application and confirm I am logged in.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a user logs in, the main menu (Sidebar) must be displayed.
2. The main menu contains placeholder items for the planned pages (Dashboard, Stock, etc.).
3. The name or email of the currently logged-in user is displayed on the screen.
4. There is a functional button for logging out.
5. When the user logs out, the main menu is hidden, and the system navigates back to the login page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 completion notes]
- Clerk authentication is fully configured and working
- Authentication utilities available in src/server/auth.ts with async support
- useUser() and UserButton components are available from @clerk/nextjs
- Route protection middleware is active and protecting all routes by default
- Homepage redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in successfully
- (auth) route group structure is established for authentication pages

### UI Layout System Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-components.md#frontend-components]
- **Responsibility**: Main structure of the web page, consisting of a **Sidebar** for navigation and a content area for displaying the main content of each page
- **Dependencies**: **Clerk** (to display user information and a Logout button)
- **Integration**: Sidebar should be part of the main layout system after authentication

### Tech Stack for UI Components
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack-updated-versions-august-2025.md]
- **UI Component Library**: Shadcn/ui (Latest) - Pre-built components for UI creation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1.x - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Iconography**: Lucide Icons 0.539.x - Icon set for navigation and UI elements
- **State Management**: React Hooks for component state, Zustand if complex state needed
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.x with App Router for page routing

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Main Layout**: `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx` - Main layout with the Sidebar for authenticated pages
- **Route Groups**: Use (main) route group for pages after login (Dashboard, Stock, etc.)
- **Dashboard Page**: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Landing page after authentication
- **Component Location**: `src/components/ui/` - Shadcn/ui components storage location
- **Authentication Check**: Integration with existing Clerk authentication system

### Authentication Integration
[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md#user-login-session-verification-workflow]
- **User Flow**: After successful authentication, user should see Dashboard page with navigation
- **Session Verification**: Frontend can access user data through Clerk's useUser() hook
- **Logout Flow**: When user logs out, system navigates back to login page
- **Token Management**: Session handling is managed entirely by Clerk

### Security and Route Protection
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#security]
- **Authentication**: Handled entirely by Clerk with automatic session management
- **Route Protection**: All sensitive pages protected by middleware (already implemented)
- **User Access**: Only logged-in users can access main layout and sidebar navigation
- **Session State**: User authentication state is managed by Clerk's React hooks

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Main layout with sidebar: `src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`
- Dashboard page: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Sidebar navigation component: `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (if needed as separate component)
- Additional navigation components in `src/components/ui/` as needed

### Navigation Structure Requirements
Based on epic requirements and system architecture:
- **Dashboard** - Business intelligence summary page
- **Stock** - Product and inventory management
- **Customers** - Customer relationship management
- **Sales** - Sales transaction management  
- **Repairs** - Repair job management
- All items should be placeholder links for now, leading to basic placeholder pages

### Component Styling Standards
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#coding-standards]
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Utilize Lucide Icons for navigation menu icons
- Implement consistent spacing and typography
- Follow Shadcn/ui component patterns for consistency

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#testing-strategy]
- **Framework**: Jest v30.0.x and React Testing Library (included with Next.js)
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` pattern
- **Requirements**: 
  - Test sidebar navigation component rendering
  - Test user profile display with different authentication states
  - Test logout functionality and navigation flow
  - Test main layout integration with route protection
  - Test responsive layout behavior
- **Standards**: Follow Testing Pyramid approach - focus on unit tests

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Clerk authentication
- Sidebar must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Navigation must respect route protection middleware
- User profile display must handle loading and error states
- Logout must properly clear session and redirect to sign-in
