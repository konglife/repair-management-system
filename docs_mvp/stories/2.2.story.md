# Story 2.2: Manage Product Units

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to be able to add, view, edit, and delete product units,
**so that** I can specify how my products are measured.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The user can create a new Unit with a name (e.g., "piece", "box", "meter").
2. The user can view a list of all existing Units.
3. The user can edit the name of an existing Unit.
4. The user can delete an existing Unit (with a confirmation dialog).
5. All these functions are located within the "Stock Management" page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 2.1 completion notes]
- Category management is fully implemented and working in Stock Management page
- tRPC infrastructure is established with category router successfully integrated
- Stock page structure is ready for additional sections (Units, Products)
- Shadcn/ui components are integrated: Table, Input, Dialog, Button, Card components
- Responsive layout system with mobile-friendly design is implemented
- Testing patterns established with Jest and React Testing Library
- Build pipeline is clean with zero TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#unit]
- **Unit Model**: Simple model with `id: String` (unique CUID) and `name: String` (unique)
- **Purpose**: Used for defining the unit for each product item (e.g., "piece", "strip", "box")
- **Relationships**: One Unit can be used for many Products (One-to-Many)
- **TypeScript Interface**:
```typescript
interface Unit {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#unit]
- **Prisma Model**:
```prisma
model Unit {
  id       String    @id @default(cuid())
  name     String    @unique
  products Product[] // Relation: One Unit can have many Products
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#unitRouter]
- **tRPC Router Structure**: Units will be part of main appRouter as `units: unitRouter`
- **Router Location**: Create in `src/server/api/routers/unit.ts`
- **Required Procedures**:
  - `getAll`: Query procedure to fetch all units
  - `create`: Mutation procedure with Zod input validation
  - `update`: Mutation procedure with id and name validation
  - `delete`: Mutation procedure with id validation
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod for all input validation in tRPC procedures
- **Error Handling**: tRPC built-in error handling system

### Technical Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack-updated-versions-august-2025.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.x API Routes with tRPC 11.4.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (NeonDB) with Prisma 6.14.x ORM
- **Type Safety**: Full end-to-end type safety with tRPC
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.x with App Router
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui Latest with Tailwind CSS 4.1.x ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons 0.539.x ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Design System**: Consistent component library with proper theming ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Stock Page**: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` - Existing Stock Management page (enhance with Units section)
- **Unit Router**: `src/server/api/routers/unit.ts` - tRPC router for units
- **Main Router**: Add unitRouter to `src/server/api/root.ts` as units
- **Components**: Use `src/components/ui/` for reusable UI components (already available)
- **Database Schema**: Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with Unit model

### Security and Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#security]
- **Authentication**: All API routes protected by tRPC's `protectedProcedure`
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation using Zod within tRPC routers
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints on unit names prevent duplicates
- **Authorization**: Only logged-in users can access unit management

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: Epic 2.2 Acceptance Criteria]
- **Location**: All unit functions within "Stock Management" page
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Required for delete operations
- **Form Validation**: Proper validation and error feedback
- **User Experience**: Clear success/error messages and loading states
- **Layout Integration**: Must integrate with existing Category section on Stock page

### File Locations and Structure
Based on unified project structure and requirements:
- **Stock Page**: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` (enhance existing file)
- **Unit Router**: `src/server/api/routers/unit.ts`
- **Updated App Router**: `src/server/api/root.ts` (add units)
- **Prisma Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma` (add Unit model)
- **UI Components**: Leverage existing `src/components/ui/` Shadcn components

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#testing-strategy]
- **Framework**: Jest 30.0.x and React Testing Library (included with Next.js)
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` pattern
- **Requirements**:
  - Unit tests for tRPC unit router procedures
  - Component tests for unit UI elements
  - Integration tests for unit CRUD workflows
  - Form validation testing
  - Error handling and edge case testing
- **Standards**: Follow Testing Pyramid approach - focus on unit tests
- **Critical Business Logic**: Unit creation, update, and deletion must be thoroughly tested

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain referential integrity with Product relationships
- Unit names must be unique across the system
- Deletion should be restricted if units have associated products
- All database operations must use Prisma transactions where appropriate
- UI must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Must integrate with existing authentication and navigation system
- **Layout Consideration**: Must enhance existing Stock page without breaking Category functionality

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
