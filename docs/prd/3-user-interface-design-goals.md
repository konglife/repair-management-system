# 3. User Interface Design Goals
The UI/UX for Version 2.0 will build upon the existing design documented in `docs_mvp/ui-ux-specification.md`. The primary goals are to enhance usability and data visualization. All new components, such as charts, search bars, and date filters, must integrate seamlessly with the existing Tailwind CSS theme and maintain a consistent, clean, and modern aesthetic. The new Settings and Reports pages should follow the established layout patterns of the existing application.

## Interaction Pattern Consistency
All Stock Management sections (Categories, Units, Products, Record Purchase) should follow consistent interaction patterns:
- Header sections with section title on the left and action buttons on the right
- "Add [Item]" buttons with consistent styling using the Plus icon
- Collapsible forms that toggle visibility when action buttons are clicked
- Consistent form layout with Cancel and Submit buttons
- Unified form validation and feedback patterns
