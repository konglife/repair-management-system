# 3. User Interface Design Goals
The UI/UX for Version 2.0 will build upon the existing design documented in `docs_mvp/ui-ux-specification.md`. The primary goals are to enhance usability and data visualization. All new components, such as charts, search bars, and date filters, must integrate seamlessly with the existing Tailwind CSS theme and maintain a consistent, clean, and modern aesthetic. The new Settings and Reports pages should follow the established layout patterns of the existing application.
