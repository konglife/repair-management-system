# **1. Goals and Background Context**

### **1.1. Goals**
* To improve the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) across five core modules (Stock, Sales, Repairs, Customers, Dashboard), making them more modern, intuitive, and consistent.
* To increase user efficiency by streamlining workflows and reducing unnecessary steps.
* To add the ability to backdate entries, accommodating real-world operational needs.
* To enhance data visualization in summaries (Stat Cards) and reports, making them real-time and more useful for rapid, accurate decision-making.

### **1.2. Background Context**
This document defines the scope and requirements for enhancing the existing Repair Management System (v2.0). This initiative focuses on addressing user-identified pain points from daily operations. The core logic of the existing system will be preserved, with enhancements targeted specifically at the UI/UX, reporting system, and dashboard to create a more complete and business-responsive application.

*Assumption: Development will occur on the existing codebase, which was built using the bmad method and claude code, with no changes to the core technology stack.*
