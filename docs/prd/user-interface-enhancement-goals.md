# User Interface Enhancement Goals

- **Existing UI Integration**: The primary change on the `/reports` page is the functionality of the "Generate Report" button.
- **New Screens**: A new dynamic page route will be created, for example, at `/reports/summary`. This page will contain the full report view.
- **Design Reference**: The layout and styling of the new report page must be based on the provided example file: **`monthly_report_html_starter_prompt_puppeteer.html`**.
