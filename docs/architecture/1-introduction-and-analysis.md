### **1.1. Architectural Goals**
* **Seamless Integration:** Design all enhancements to align with the existing architecture and code patterns of the project.
* **Component Reusability:** Emphasize the creation and modification of UI Components that can be reused across the application.
* **State Management Consistency:** Establish a clear and consistent pattern for frontend state management to ensure efficient and predictable data updates.
* **Maintainability:** Structure the new code in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

### **1.2. Existing Project Analysis Summary**
