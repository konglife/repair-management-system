# 11\. Implementation & Development Standards

This section summarizes all the standards and best practices that will be used in developing, testing, and deploying our application.

### 11.1 Coding Standards & Naming Conventions

This is the section we just summarized and agreed upon, which consists of 5 key rules and naming standards to guide the AI Agent's work.

-----

### 11.2 Testing Strategy

  * **Testing Philosophy:** We will adopt the **Testing Pyramid** approach, focusing primarily on Unit Tests, followed by Integration Tests, and End-to-End (E2E) Tests for critical user flows.
  * **Unit & Integration Tests:** We will use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, which come with Next.js, to test Backend logic and Frontend components.
  * **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** It is recommended to use **Playwright** for future E2E testing to simulate real user interactions from start to finish.
  * **Requirement:** Critical business logic, such as average cost calculation, stock deduction, and profit calculation, must always be covered by Unit Tests.

### 11.3 Development Workflow

  * **Local Setup:** Developers can set up the entire project with the `pnpm install` command.
  * **Running the App:** Use the `pnpm dev` command to run the entire application (both Frontend and Backend) in Development Mode.
  * **Database Management:**
      * Use `pnpm prisma migrate dev` to update the database structure according to `schema.prisma`.
      * Use `pnpm prisma studio` to open a web interface for directly viewing and editing data in the database.

### 11.4 Security

  * **Authentication & Authorization:** Handled entirely by **Clerk**. All API routes related to sensitive data will be protected by tRPC's `protectedProcedure`, which only allows logged-in users to access them.
  * **Input Validation:** All data sent from the user will be strictly validated on the backend using **Zod** within tRPC routers to prevent invalid data.
  * **Secrets Management:** All API Keys and Connection Strings will be stored in the `.env` file and will not be exposed in the frontend code.

-----

### 11.5 Deployment

  * **Platform:** **Vercel**
  * **Process:** Deployment will be automated upon pushing code to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub) on the `main` branch.
  * **Environments:** Vercel will manage the Production Environment and automatically create Preview Environments for testing new features.

-----

### 11.6 Error Handling & Monitoring

  * **Error Handling:** tRPC has an excellent built-in error handling system. When an error occurs on the Backend, the Frontend will receive a well-typed error, making it easy to display user-friendly error messages.
  * **Logging & Monitoring:** For the first version (MVP), we will use the **Vercel Logs** and **Vercel Analytics** systems that come with the platform, requiring no additional setup, to monitor the application's performance and errors.
