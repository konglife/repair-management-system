# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Existing Project Analysis & Integration Strategy
This document outlines the architectural enhancements required to implement Version 2.0 of the Repair Management System. The design prioritizes seamless integration with the existing MVP architecture (documented in `docs_mvp/architecture.md`), ensuring that all new features align with established patterns while introducing modern, scalable solutions.

The core of the existing system is a well-structured Next.js application using Prisma for data access and Tailwind CSS for styling. The V2.0 architecture will extend this foundation, introducing new database models, API endpoints, and frontend components in a minimally disruptive manner.

**Key Integration Strategy**:
- **Database**: A new `BusinessProfile` model will be added via a new Prisma migration file.
- **Backend**: New API routes will be created within the existing `src/app/api/` structure to handle new functionalities like settings and reporting.
- **Frontend**: New components for charts, search, and pages will be created within the existing `src/components/` and `src/app/` structure, reusing existing UI elements where possible to maintain consistency.
