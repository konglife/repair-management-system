# Story 1.5: Standardize Form Labels

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** all form fields to have clear labels, like in the Record Purchase form,
**so that** I know exactly what information to enter.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add descriptive labels to all fields in the "Create New Product" form
2. Ensure label styling is consistent with the "Record Purchase" form
3. Labels should use the same format: `<label className="text-sm font-medium mb-2 block">`
4. All form fields must have proper visual hierarchy and accessibility
5. Maintain existing form functionality while adding labels
6. Ensure labels are positioned above their corresponding input fields
7. Use descriptive text that clearly indicates what information is expected
8. Test that the form works correctly after adding labels

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Add labels to Create New Product form fields (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7)
  - [x] Add "Product Name" label to the product name input field
  - [x] Add "Sale Price (฿)" label to the price input field
  - [x] Add "Category" label to the category dropdown
  - [x] Add "Unit" label to the unit dropdown
  - [x] Apply consistent label styling: `text-sm font-medium mb-2 block`
- [x] Task 2: Verify accessibility and visual consistency (AC: 4, 5, 8)
  - [x] Test form submission with all labeled fields
  - [x] Verify tab order and keyboard navigation works properly
  - [x] Compare visual styling with Record Purchase form for consistency
  - [x] Test form validation still works correctly
- [x] Task 3: Unit testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Test form component rendering with proper labels
  - [x] Test accessibility attributes are present
  - [x] Test form functionality remains intact
  - [x] Test label-input associations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4:
- Successfully enhanced UI components while maintaining existing functionality
- CurrencyInput component was successfully integrated into the Create Product form
- Pattern of making incremental UI improvements works well without disrupting workflows
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding enhancements
- Comprehensive testing ensures no regression issues

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. This is purely a frontend UI enhancement that adds labels to existing form fields without changing any database schema or API requirements. All form submission logic and data handling remain unchanged. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no form labeling related schema changes specified]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints or changes required for this story. The form labels enhancement is purely a frontend improvement that does not affect any backend APIs. All existing product creation API calls will continue to work exactly as they currently do. [Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - no API changes needed for form labeling]

### Component Specifications
[Source: Codebase analysis of src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx]
The Create New Product form is located in the Stock module page component at lines ~800-878. The form currently contains:
- Product name input field (line ~806-812) - needs "Product Name" label
- Sale price input field using CurrencyInput (line ~815-821) - needs "Sale Price (฿)" label  
- Category dropdown (line ~823-835) - needs "Category" label
- Unit dropdown (line ~837-849) - needs "Unit" label

Reference implementation exists in the Record Purchase form (lines ~1034-1062) showing proper label usage:
- `<label className="text-sm font-medium mb-2 block">Product</label>`
- `<label className="text-sm font-medium mb-2 block">Quantity</label>`
- `<label className="text-sm font-medium mb-2 block">Cost Per Unit (฿)</label>`

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md and codebase analysis]
- Primary file to modify: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` (Create New Product form section, lines ~800-878)
- No new files need to be created for this story
- The form is embedded within the existing Stock page component structure
- Labels should be added directly above each form input element

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: UI component testing using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Tests should focus on the form component behavior
- **Manual Testing**: Full regression test to ensure form labeling does not break existing Stock module functionality
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test form rendering with proper labels
  - Test form submission functionality remains intact
  - Test accessibility compliance (label-input associations)
  - Test visual consistency with existing labeled forms
  - Test keyboard navigation and tab order
  - Regression testing to ensure product creation workflow continues working

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions from the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing form styling in the Record Purchase form
- No new dependencies required - this is a pure HTML/CSS enhancement

### Project Structure Notes
This enhancement aligns perfectly with the existing project structure. No new files or architectural changes are required. The labels will be added directly to the existing Create New Product form within the Stock page component. The implementation follows the established pattern already demonstrated in the Record Purchase form within the same file.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Focus on component behavior testing
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on form behavior, accessibility, and user interactions
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test form component renders with all proper labels
  - Test label-input associations for accessibility compliance
  - Test form submission continues to work correctly
  - Test keyboard navigation and tab order
  - Test visual styling consistency
  - Regression testing to ensure existing Stock functionality remains intact
