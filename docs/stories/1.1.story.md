# Story 1.1: Implement Sidebar Toggle

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** desktop user,
**I want** a button to collapse and expand the sidebar,
**so that** I can maximize my content viewing area.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The toggle button should look like a modern hamburger button
2. When collapsed, only the icons remain, following common web standards
3. Remember the collapse/expand state (persist user preference)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create sidebar toggle button component (AC: 1)
  - [x] Design hamburger button with proper styling using Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Add hover and active states for better UX
  - [x] Position button appropriately in the sidebar header
- [x] Task 2: Implement sidebar collapse/expand functionality (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create state management for sidebar collapsed/expanded state
  - [x] Implement CSS transitions for smooth animation
  - [x] Ensure only icons are visible when collapsed
  - [x] Adjust main content area width when sidebar state changes
- [x] Task 3: Implement state persistence (AC: 3)
  - [x] Use localStorage to remember sidebar state between sessions
  - [x] Load saved state on application initialization
  - [x] Handle edge cases (first visit, localStorage unavailable)
- [x] Task 4: Update existing layout components
  - [x] Modify the main layout to accommodate dynamic sidebar width
  - [x] Ensure responsive behavior is maintained
  - [x] Test across different screen sizes
- [x] Task 5: Unit testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Test toggle button functionality
  - [x] Test state persistence with localStorage
  - [x] Test responsive behavior
  - [x] Test CSS transitions and animations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous insights available.

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs for sidebar toggle functionality. Implementation should follow existing UI patterns in the codebase.

### File Locations
Based on the source tree structure [Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md], new components should be created in:
- UI components: `src/components/ui/` directory for reusable components
- Layout modifications should be made to existing layout files in `src/app/`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests**: New UI components should have unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Focus on critical user interactions (toggle functionality, state persistence)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]:
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- No additional dependencies required for basic sidebar toggle functionality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story - only frontend state management needed.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this story - purely frontend functionality.

### Project Structure Notes
No structural conflicts identified. The sidebar toggle enhancement fits within the existing project structure without requiring new folders or major architectural changes.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components (e.g., `__tests__` directories or `.test.tsx` files)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on user interactions and state management
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test toggle button click behavior
  - Test sidebar state persistence with localStorage
  - Test responsive layout adjustments
  - Verify CSS transitions work correctly
