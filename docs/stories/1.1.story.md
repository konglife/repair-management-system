# Story 1.1: Refactor Sales and Customers Forms for Non-Refreshing Updates

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the data tables to update instantly after adding a new sale or customer,
**so that** my workflow is seamless and not interrupted by a page reload.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Upon successful creation of a new sale, the new record appears in the sales table immediately, and the page does not perform a full reload.
2. Upon successful creation of a new customer, the new record appears in the customers table immediately, and the page does not perform a full reload.
3. The implementation pattern must mirror the `useMutation` and `utils.invalidate()` logic found in the Stock Management module.
4. A success toast notification is displayed after each successful submission.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Refactor Sales Page Data Refresh Logic (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [x] Replace manual `refetchSales()` calls with `utils.sales.getAll.invalidate()` pattern
  - [x] Replace manual `refetchAnalytics()` calls with `utils.sales.getAnalytics.invalidate()` pattern
  - [x] Add success toast notification after sale creation
  - [x] Test instant table updates without page reload

- [x] Task 2: Refactor Customers Page Data Refresh Logic (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Replace manual `refetchCustomers()` calls with `utils.customers.getAll.invalidate()` pattern  
  - [x] Add success toast notification after customer creation and updates
  - [x] Test instant table updates without page reload

- [x] Task 3: Unit Testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Update existing tests for sales page mutations to verify invalidate calls
  - [x] Update existing tests for customers page mutations to verify invalidate calls
  - [x] Add tests for toast notifications

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, so no previous insights are available.

### Data Models
The story works with existing Prisma models:
- **Customer model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]: Contains id, name, phone (optional), address (optional), createdAt. Related to Sales and Repairs.
- **Sale model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]: Contains id, totalAmount, totalCost, createdAt, customerId. Related to Customer and SaleItems.
- **SaleItem model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma]: Individual items in a sale with quantity, salePrice, costAtTime.

### API Specifications
- **Sales Router** [Source: src/server/api/routers/sale.ts]: Provides create mutation for sales that needs refactoring
- **Customers Router** [Source: src/server/api/routers/customer.ts]: Provides create and update mutations that need refactoring
- **Dashboard Router** [Source: Architecture docs]: Contains analytics endpoints that get invalidated by sales changes

### Component Specifications
- **Sales Page Component** [Source: src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx]: Contains createSaleMutation currently using manual refetch pattern
- **Customers Page Component** [Source: src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx]: Contains createCustomerMutation and updateCustomerMutation using manual refetch pattern
- **Utils Pattern** [Source: src/app/(main)/settings/page.tsx]: Shows proper usage of `const utils = api.useUtils()` and `utils.*.invalidate()` calls

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Sales page: `src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx`
- Customers page: `src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx`
- API routers: `src/server/api/routers/sale.ts` and `src/server/api/routers/customer.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- **tRPC Version**: Using tRPC 11.4.x with existing mutation patterns [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **React Pattern**: Must maintain existing React Hooks + local state pattern [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **Toast Implementation**: Use existing alert() pattern or upgrade to proper toast system

### Testing
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **Test Location**: Alongside component files as `.test.tsx` files [Source: existing structure]
- **Test Strategy**: Unit tests for business logic, component tests for UI interactions [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **Coverage Requirements**: Focus on critical workflows (sales, customer management) [Source: CLAUDE.md]
