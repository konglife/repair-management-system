# Story 3.2: Implement Stock Threshold Setting

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As an** admin,
**I want** to be able to set a custom "Low Stock Threshold" in a dedicated "Stock Settings" section on the Settings page,
**so that** the dashboard alert is tailored to my business needs and organized logically within settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create a new "Stock Settings" section on the Settings page (FR36)
2. Move the Low Stock Threshold field from the Business Profile section to the new Stock Settings section
3. Maintain all existing validation and functionality for the Low Stock Threshold field
4. Ensure the Stock Settings section has appropriate styling and layout consistent with the Business Profile section
5. Update the form structure to handle both Business Profile and Stock Settings sections independently
6. Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
7. Preserve all existing form validation and error handling

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Restructure Settings page with separate sections (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] Create new "Stock Settings" Card component below Business Profile
  - [x] Move Low Stock Threshold field from Business Profile to Stock Settings section
  - [x] Add appropriate section title, description, and icon for Stock Settings
  - [x] Ensure consistent styling and spacing with existing Business Profile section
- [x] Task 2: Update form handling for multiple sections (AC: 3, 5, 7)
  - [x] Modify form state management to handle separate sections appropriately
  - [x] Ensure existing validation logic continues to work for Low Stock Threshold
  - [x] Update form submission to handle both Business Profile and Stock Settings data
  - [x] Test that all form validation and error handling still works correctly
- [x] Task 3: Responsive design and integration testing (AC: 6)
  - [x] Test responsive layout on mobile and desktop devices
  - [x] Verify navigation integration and form functionality
  - [x] Ensure consistent UX across both sections
  - [x] Test form submission and data persistence for both sections

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1:
- BusinessProfile database model already includes `lowStockThreshold` field with default value 5
- Settings tRPC router fully implemented with getBusinessProfile and createOrUpdateBusinessProfile procedures
- Form validation patterns established using Zod schemas with proper error handling
- Settings page structure and navigation integration complete with responsive design
- All form state management, validation, and submission logic already working for Low Stock Threshold field

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md]
**No database changes required** - The BusinessProfile model already includes the lowStockThreshold field:
```prisma
model BusinessProfile {
  id                String  @id @default(cuid())
  shopName          String
  address           String?
  phoneNumber       String?
  contactEmail      String?
  logoUrl           String?
  lowStockThreshold Int     @default(5)
  @@map("business_profiles")
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md]
**No API changes required** - The existing Settings tRPC procedures already handle the lowStockThreshold field:
- `GET /api/settings` - Already retrieves lowStockThreshold from BusinessProfile
- `POST /api/settings` - Already handles create/update operations for lowStockThreshold
- Input validation using Zod schemas already includes lowStockThreshold validation

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**Existing File to Modify:**
- `/src/app/(main)/settings/page.tsx` - Restructure into separate Business Profile and Stock Settings sections

**UI Layout Requirements:**
- Business Profile Card: Keep existing fields (Shop Name, Phone, Email, Address, Logo URL)
- NEW Stock Settings Card: Move Low Stock Threshold field here with appropriate section styling
- Both cards should follow the same visual design patterns with CardHeader and CardContent
- Use appropriate icons for each section (Settings for Business Profile, suitable icon for Stock Settings)
- Maintain responsive grid layout and form validation patterns

**Technical Requirements:**
- Preserve all existing form state management and validation logic
- Maintain existing TypeScript typing throughout
- Keep existing error handling and loading states
- No changes needed to tRPC integration or database operations

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
**Files to Modify:**
- `/src/app/(main)/settings/page.tsx` - Restructure page layout into separate sections

**No New Files Required:**
- Database model already complete
- tRPC router already handles all required operations
- No additional API endpoints needed

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Use existing tech stack components: shadcn/ui Card, CardContent, CardHeader
- Follow established form patterns and styling conventions from existing Settings page
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns and responsive design
- No new external dependencies required
- Form validation should continue using existing patterns (React state, validation functions)

### Project Structure Notes
The Settings page restructuring aligns perfectly with the existing project structure. The change is purely organizational within the existing page component, moving the Low Stock Threshold field to a dedicated section for better UX organization as specified in FR36.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
**Testing Standards**:
- **Test Location**: Update existing test file `/src/app/(main)/settings/page.test.tsx`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library (existing setup)
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on Settings page restructure and form functionality

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test that Low Stock Threshold field appears in Stock Settings section instead of Business Profile section
- Test form submission continues to work correctly for both sections
- Test existing form validation logic still works for Low Stock Threshold
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes for both sections
- Test that all existing Settings page functionality remains intact
- Test loading states and error handling for both sections
- Verify that form data persistence works correctly after restructure
