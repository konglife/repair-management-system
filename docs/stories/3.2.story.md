# Story 3.2: Edit Customer Details

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to be able to edit the details of an existing customer,
**so that** I can keep their information up to date.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. From the customer list page, the user can choose to "edit" the information of each customer.
2. The edit form must display the customer's current information (name, phone number, address).
3. The user can update the information and save the changes.
4. The updated information is correctly displayed on the customer list page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 3.1 completion notes]
- Customer CRUD infrastructure is fully established with working create and getAll procedures
- Customer data model and Prisma schema are implemented and tested
- tRPC customer router exists at `src/server/api/routers/customer.ts` and is integrated into main appRouter
- Customer UI components follow established patterns using Shadcn/ui components (Table, Dialog, Button, etc.)
- Responsive customer list page exists at `src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` with add customer functionality
- Testing patterns are established with Jest and React Testing Library for both router and UI components
- Build pipeline is clean with zero TypeScript errors and working customer management functionality

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#customer + Story 3.1 implementation]
- **Customer Model**: Already implemented with all required fields
- **Key Attributes**:
  - `id: String` (unique CUID - non-editable)
  - `name: String` (required - editable)
  - `phone: String?` (optional - editable)
  - `address: String?` (optional - editable)
  - `createdAt: DateTime` (auto-generated - non-editable)
- **Update Requirements**: Only name, phone, and address fields should be editable
- **Validation Rules**: Same as create - name is required, phone and address are optional

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#customer]
- **Prisma Model**: Existing Customer model supports updates through standard Prisma client operations
- **Update Operation**: Use `prisma.customer.update({ where: { id }, data: { name, phone, address } })`

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#customerRouter + Story 3.1 implementation]
- **Router Location**: Extend existing `src/server/api/routers/customer.ts`
- **New Procedure Required**: 
  - `update`: Mutation procedure with Zod validation for id (required), name (required), phone (optional), address (optional)
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod schema:
  ```typescript
  z.object({
    id: z.string().cuid(),
    name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
    phone: z.string().optional(),
    address: z.string().optional()
  })
  ```
- **Return Type**: Updated Customer object for optimistic UI updates
