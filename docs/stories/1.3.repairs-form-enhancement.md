# Story 1.3: Repairs Form Enhancement

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** repair shop manager,
**I want** the Create New Repair Job form popup to be larger with reorganized UI and date selection capability, plus automatic stats updates,
**so that** I can create repair jobs more efficiently with better usability and see immediate impact on repair metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Create New Repair Job" form popup must be larger, and its internal UI must be reorganized for better usability (FR3.1)
2. The "Create New Repair Job" form must include a "Date" field that allows users to select a past date (FR3.2)
3. The summary statistic cards on the "Repairs" page must update automatically after a new repair job is successfully added (FR3.3)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Expand popup size and reorganize UI layout (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update DialogContent CSS class to use larger maxWidth (e.g., `sm:max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl`)
  - [x] Reorganize form sections for better visual hierarchy and usability
  - [x] Improve spacing, grouping, and section organization within the popup
  - [x] Test popup responsiveness and ensure it fits properly on different screen sizes
- [x] Task 2: Add date field to Create Repair Job form (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement date picker using existing Shadcn UI Calendar and Popover components
  - [x] Update repair creation API to accept optional repairDate parameter
  - [x] Add form validation for date field
  - [x] Update form reset functionality to include date field
- [x] Task 3: Implement automatic stats card updates (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add automatic analytics refetch alongside repairs refetch in mutation onSuccess callback
  - [x] Ensure analytics query revalidates after successful repair job creation
  - [x] Test real-time updates of all stats cards (Total Repairs, Revenue, Average Repair Cost, Labor Revenue, Parts Cost)
- [x] Task 4: Testing
  - [x] Component tests for expanded popup layout and usability
  - [x] Component tests for date picker integration
  - [x] Integration tests for automatic analytics updates
  - [x] Form submission tests with custom dates
  - [x] Responsiveness testing for larger popup size

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1 & 1.2:
- Successfully implemented date picker using Shadcn UI Calendar and Popover components with date-fns library
- Established pattern for automatic stats updates: call analytics refetch in mutation onSuccess callback
- Optional date parameter pattern proven effective (backward compatible API approach)
- Existing Shadcn calendar.tsx and popover.tsx components available for reuse

### Data Models
**Repair Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:114-128]:
- Contains `id`, `description`, `totalCost`, `partsCost`, `laborCost`, `createdAt` fields
- `createdAt` field supports custom date selection (DateTime type)
- Relations to `Customer` and `UsedPart[]`

**UsedPart Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:131-142]:
- Contains `quantity`, `costAtTime` 
- Relations to `Repair` and `Product`
- Used for parts tracking in repair jobs

**Customer Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:67-80]:
- Contains `id`, `name`, `phone`, `address`, `createdAt`
- Used in form customer selection dropdown

### API Specifications
**Current Repairs API** [Source: src/server/api/routers/repair.ts]:
- `create` mutation (lines 104-220): Currently accepts `customerId`, `description`, `totalCost`, `usedParts[]`
- Needs enhancement to accept optional `repairDate` parameter like sales/purchase APIs
- `getAnalytics` procedure (lines 223-287): Already provides stats for cards (totalRepairs, totalRevenue, averageRepairCost, totalLaborRevenue, totalPartsCost)
- Uses Prisma transactions for data consistency and stock deduction

### Component Specifications
**Current Repairs Page Structure** [Source: src/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx]:
- Dialog form currently at lines 422-430 with `max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh]` (needs expansion to larger size)
- Analytics cards display repair statistics (need automatic updates)
- Form state: `showCreateRepairForm`, `selectedCustomerId`, `repairDescription`, `totalCost`, `usedParts` (lines 78-85)
- `refetchRepairs()` call in mutation onSuccess - needs analytics refetch addition

**Existing UI Components Available**:
- Shadcn Calendar and Popover components (from Stories 1.1 & 1.2)
- PartsAutocomplete component (already used in current form)
- date-fns library for date formatting

### File Locations
**Primary Files to Modify**:
- `src/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` - Main repairs page (expand dialog size, add date field, auto-refresh analytics)
- `src/server/api/routers/repair.ts` - Repairs API router (add optional repairDate parameter)

**Component Structure**:
```
src/
├── app/(main)/repairs/
│   └── page.tsx                    # Main modifications for larger popup and date field
├── server/api/routers/
│   └── repair.ts                   # API enhancement for date support
├── components/ui/
│   ├── calendar.tsx               # Existing from Stories 1.1 & 1.2
│   └── popover.tsx               # Existing from Stories 1.1 & 1.2
```

### Technical Constraints
**Dialog Size Enhancement** [Source: docs/architecture/2-epic-1-core-modules-uiux-and-functionality-enhancement.md:28]:
- Current: `max-w-4xl` - Architecture recommends using larger Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Suggested: `sm:max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` for improved usability
- Maintain `max-h-[90vh] overflow-auto` for vertical scrolling if needed

**Date Picker Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/2-epic-1-core-modules-uiux-and-functionality-enhancement.md:19-21]:
- Use same pattern as Stories 1.1 & 1.2: Shadcn UI Calendar and Popover components
- Components already available, date-fns already installed as dependency

**State Management Pattern for Auto-Updates** [Source: docs/architecture/2-epic-1-core-modules-uiux-and-functionality-enhancement.md:5-12]:
- Architecture recommends auto-revalidation after mutations
- Current implementation uses manual refetch calls after mutations
- For automatic stats updates: add analytics refetch call in mutation onSuccess callback alongside existing repairs refetch

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Framework** [Source: existing test structure]:
- Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Follow existing patterns from repairs page tests
- Include accessibility testing with ARIA attributes
- Mock tRPC calls and external dependencies

**Test Coverage Required**:
- Expanded popup display and improved layout usability
- Date picker functionality and form integration
- Automatic analytics card updates after repair creation
- Form submission with custom repair dates
- Responsiveness testing for larger dialog size
- Integration testing for complete repair creation workflow

### Testing
**Test File Location**:
- Update existing `src/app/(main)/repairs/page.test.tsx` for dialog expansion and date field
- Add new test cases for improved UI layout and date picker integration
- Test automatic analytics updates

**Test Standards**:
- Mock tRPC queries and mutations
- Test user interactions with expanded dialog form
- Verify analytics card updates after successful repair creation
- Test date validation and custom date submission
- Test responsiveness of larger popup on various screen sizes
- Ensure form reset functionality includes all fields including date

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Dialog expansion: Verify popup size increase and improved usability/organization
- Date picker: Test date selection, validation, and custom date repair creation
- Analytics updates: Verify all five stats cards refresh automatically after repair creation
- Form integration: Test complete workflow from customer selection through successful repair job creation
- Regression testing: Ensure existing repair functionality remains intact
