# Story 2.5: Implement Recent Activities Feed

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** admin,
**I want** a "Recent Activities" feed on the dashboard,
**so that** I can stay updated on the latest events in the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a "Recent Activities" table/widget to the dashboard (FR25)
2. Display recent activities including sales, repairs, and purchase records
3. Show activity type, description, amount, customer name (where applicable), and relative time
4. Display activities in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
5. Include appropriate icons for each activity type (sales, repairs, purchases)
6. Ensure proper loading states and error handling
7. Maintain responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
8. Limit display to the most recent 10 activities
9. Use Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting for amounts (existing FR2 compliance)

  - [x] Verify Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting for amounts
  - [x] Ensure responsive design across screen sizes
  - [x] Confirm loading states and error handling work correctly
- [x] Task 3: Integration verification and testing (AC: All)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.4:
- Dashboard analytics patterns are well-established and consistently implemented
- Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting patterns already established and working
- tRPC procedure enhancement pattern for analytics data proven effective
- Frontend component patterns for responsive analytics cards established
- Build and lint processes established and working correctly
- Pattern of extending existing pages with new functionality works well
- Component integration into dashboard grid system established

**IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: The Recent Activities functionality appears to already be implemented in the codebase:
- RecentActivities component exists at `src/components/dashboard/RecentActivities.tsx`
- Backend tRPC procedure `api.dashboard.getRecentActivities` exists in `src/server/api/routers/dashboard.ts`
- Component is already integrated into the dashboard at `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`

This story may represent documentation of existing functionality or verification that the implementation meets all acceptance criteria.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. The Recent Activities feature will aggregate data from existing models (Sales, Repairs, PurchaseRecords) to display recent system events. All data is pulled from existing database tables without schema changes required. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no recent activities schema changes specified]

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md]
Recent Activities functionality uses existing tRPC procedures rather than new REST endpoints:
- Existing `api.dashboard.getRecentActivities` tRPC procedure aggregates recent activities
- Procedure should return activities from sales, repairs, and purchase records
- Activities include: id, type, description, amount, customerName (optional), date
- Results limited to most recent 10 activities, ordered by date descending

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**Existing Component Location:**
- `/components/dashboard/RecentActivities.tsx` - Component already exists and is implemented

**Component Requirements:**
- Display activity type icons (ShoppingCart for sales, Wrench for repairs, Package for purchases)
- Show activity description and customer name where applicable
- Display amount using Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting
- Show relative time formatting (e.g., "2m ago", "1h ago", "Just now")
- Include proper loading states with skeleton animations
- Handle error states gracefully
- Support empty state when no activities exist

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use existing analytics card styling patterns for consistency
- Ensure responsive design using existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- Apply existing loading state patterns
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Integration into existing dashboard grid layout

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- Component location: `src/components/dashboard/RecentActivities.tsx` (EXISTS)
- Dashboard integration: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` (ALREADY INTEGRATED)
- Backend procedure: `src/server/api/routers/dashboard.ts` (EXISTS)
- Component import already established in dashboard page
- Component already placed in right column of dashboard grid layout

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: RecentActivities component using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library (established pattern)
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, data rendering, and user interactions
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test component renders correctly with activity data
  - Test loading states display proper skeleton animations
  - Test error states show appropriate error messages
  - Test empty state displays when no activities exist
  - Test activity type icons display correctly for different activity types
  - Test relative time formatting works correctly
  - Test Thai Baht currency formatting in amounts
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Test integration with existing dashboard layout

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **Existing Dependencies**: Use existing UI components and established patterns
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC)
- Follow existing component patterns from current dashboard
- Maintain consistency with existing analytics card styling
- Currency formatting must use Thai Baht (฿) symbols (existing FR2 compliance)
- Components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient database queries for activity aggregation

### Project Structure Notes
This story aligns with the existing project structure and the Recent Activities component already appears to be implemented and integrated. The component follows the established pattern of dashboard widgets and is properly integrated into the existing grid layout. The implementation appears to already be in place, suggesting this story may be documenting existing functionality or ensuring it meets all acceptance criteria.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Co-located test files following established patterns
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on RecentActivities component behavior and dashboard integration
- **Manual Testing**: Verify Recent Activities feed displays correctly and doesn't break existing dashboard functionality
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test activity display with various data scenarios
  - Test loading states and error handling
  - Test responsive design across mobile and desktop
  - Test currency formatting uses Thai Baht (฿) symbols
  - Test activity type icons and descriptions
  - Test relative time formatting accuracy
  - Test integration with existing dashboard components
  - Test performance with database activity queries
