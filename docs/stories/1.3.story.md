# Story 1.3: Redesign and Implement Overview UI

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the "Overview" section of my report to have a clean, professional, and modern design,
**so that** I can easily digest the key metrics of my business at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI for the "Overview" section is refactored from a simple list into a well-designed layout using UI elements like Cards, Icons, or Badges.
2. The layout is clean, organized, and easy to read.
3. All 8 key metrics (Expenses, Total Repairs, Sales Profit, etc.) are still displayed clearly.
4. The new design is fully responsive and looks great on all screen sizes.

  - [x] Integrate new ReportHeader component
  - [x] Update OverviewMetrics component usage
  - [x] Maintain existing data flow and props structure
  - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully refactored ReportView into multiple sub-components:
- ReportHeader, OverviewMetrics, SalesTable, RepairsTable, PurchasesTable components created
- Enhanced data structure with saleItems, usedParts, purchaseData arrays
- All components follow consistent styling patterns and responsive design
- Testing infrastructure established with comprehensive test coverage

### UI/UX Design Specifications
**Printed Document Style Design** [Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md#overview-section-redesign]:

**Report Header Requirements**:
- Shop Name: Sourced from `shopInfo.name`
- Address: Sourced from `shopInfo.address`  
- Report Title: Static text "Summary Report"
- Date Period: Dynamic text format "[startDate] to [endDate]"

**Metrics Overview Layout**:
- 8 key metrics arranged in clean, two-column list format
- Each item: text label followed by bolded value (e.g., `Sales Income: **à¸¿15,000.00**`)
- NO Card components, borders, background colors, or shadows
- Minimalist, paper-like aesthetic maintained
- Horizontal rules (`<hr>`) to divide Header, Overview metrics, and data tables

### Component Specifications
**Current OverviewMetrics Component** [Source: src/components/reports/OverviewMetrics.tsx]:
- Currently uses card-style design with borders, background colors, and rounded corners
- Grid layout with `md:grid-cols-2` responsive design
- Displays 8 metrics: Expenses, Total Repairs, Total Sales, Sales Profit, Repair Income, Sales Income, Repair Profit, Gross Profit
- Uses `formatCurrency` utility from `~/lib/utils`

**Required Changes** [Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md#metrics-overview-layout]:
- Remove all card styling (borders, backgrounds, shadows, rounded corners)
- Convert to simple two-column list format
- Use standard HTML elements and Tailwind CSS classes
- Maintain responsive stacking to single column on small screens

### File Locations
**Target Files** [Source: project structure analysis]:
- Modify: `src/components/reports/OverviewMetrics.tsx` - redesign existing component
- Create: `src/components/reports/ReportHeader.tsx` - new header component (may already exist from Story 1.2)
- Modify: `src/components/reports/ReportView.tsx` - integrate new header and updated overview
- Update: `src/components/reports/OverviewMetrics.test.tsx` - update tests for new design

### Typography and Styling
**Design Standards** [Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md#typography-and-color]:
- Font: Continue using "Prompt" Google Font from global styles
- Color Palette: Minimalist black-and-white document style
- Emphasis: Use `font-bold` for values rather than colors
- Layout: Standard HTML tags (`div`, `h2`, `p`, `hr`) with Tailwind CSS

### Technical Constraints
**Component Library** [Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md#component-usage]:
- Continue exclusively using `shadcn/ui` library components
- Use standard HTML tags and Tailwind CSS for layout
- No custom components outside of existing library

**Responsiveness** [Source: docs/ui-ux-specification.md#responsiveness-strategy]:
- Desktop-first design approach
- Two-column layout stacks to single column on small screens
- Use default Tailwind breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)
- Maintain table horizontal scrolling for readability

### Testing Standards
**Frontend Component Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing]:
- Component Tests: Update tests for OverviewMetrics component with new design
- Integration Tests: Verify ReportView component integration with redesigned components
- Responsive Testing: Verify layout behavior across different screen sizes
- Regression Testing: Ensure existing functionality remains intact

**Test File Locations**: Follow existing pattern with `.test.tsx` files alongside components in `src/components/reports/`
