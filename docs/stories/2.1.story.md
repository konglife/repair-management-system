## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]
- Main layout with sidebar navigation is implemented and working
- Authentication is fully functional with Clerk
- Stock page navigation link is already present in sidebar as placeholder
- User is authenticated and can access protected routes
- tRPC infrastructure is set up and ready for API implementation

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#category]
- **Category Model**: Simple model with `id: String` (unique CUID) and `name: String` (unique)
- **Purpose**: Used for grouping products to facilitate easy management and searching
- **Relationships**: One Category can have many Products (One-to-Many)
- **TypeScript Interface**:
```typescript
interface Category {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#category]
- **Prisma Model**:
```prisma
model Category {
  id       String    @id @default(cuid())
  name     String    @unique
  products Product[] // Relation: One Category can have many Products
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#categoryRouter]
- **tRPC Router Structure**: Categories will be part of main appRouter as `categories: categoryRouter`
- **Router Location**: Create in `src/server/api/routers/category.ts`
- **Required Procedures**:
  - `getAll`: Query procedure to fetch all categories
  - `create`: Mutation procedure with Zod input validation
  - `update`: Mutation procedure with id and name validation
  - `delete`: Mutation procedure with id validation
- **Input Validation**: Use Zod for all input validation in tRPC procedures
- **Error Handling**: tRPC built-in error handling system

### Technical Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack-updated-versions-august-2025.md]
- **Backend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.x API Routes with tRPC 11.4.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (NeonDB) with Prisma 6.14.x ORM
- **Type Safety**: Full end-to-end type safety with tRPC
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.4.x with App Router
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui Latest with Tailwind CSS 4.1.x
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons 0.539.x

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Stock Page**: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` - Main Stock Management page
- **Category Router**: `src/server/api/routers/category.ts` - tRPC router for categories
- **Main Router**: Add categoryRouter to `src/server/api/root.ts` as categories
- **Components**: Use `src/components/ui/` for reusable UI components
- **Database Schema**: Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with Category model

### Security and Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#security]
- **Authentication**: All API routes protected by tRPC's `protectedProcedure`
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation using Zod within tRPC routers
- **Data Integrity**: Unique constraints on category names prevent duplicates
- **Authorization**: Only logged-in users can access category management

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: Epic 2.1 Acceptance Criteria]
- **Location**: All category functions within "Stock Management" page
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Required for delete operations
- **Form Validation**: Proper validation and error feedback
- **User Experience**: Clear success/error messages and loading states

### File Locations and Structure
Based on unified project structure and requirements:
- **Stock Page**: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx`
- **Category Router**: `src/server/api/routers/category.ts`
- **Updated App Router**: `src/server/api/root.ts` (add categories)
- **Prisma Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma` (add Category model)
- **UI Components**: `src/components/ui/` (category-specific components if needed)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md#testing-strategy]
- **Framework**: Jest 30.0.x and React Testing Library (included with Next.js)
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` pattern
- **Requirements**:
  - Unit tests for tRPC category router procedures
  - Component tests for category UI elements
  - Integration tests for category CRUD workflows
  - Form validation testing
  - Error handling and edge case testing
- **Standards**: Follow Testing Pyramid approach - focus on unit tests
- **Critical Business Logic**: Category creation, update, and deletion must be thoroughly tested

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain referential integrity with Product relationships
- Category names must be unique across the system
- Deletion should be restricted if categories have associated products
- All database operations must use Prisma transactions where appropriate
- UI must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Must integrate with existing authentication and navigation system

## Testing
