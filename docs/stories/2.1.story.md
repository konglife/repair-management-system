## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5:
- Successfully enhanced UI components while maintaining existing functionality
- Pattern of making incremental UI improvements works well without disrupting workflows
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding enhancements
- Comprehensive testing ensures no regression issues

### Performance Optimization Context
Current TrendGraph component (located at `src/app/(main)/dashboard/components/TrendGraph.tsx`) is experiencing performance issues causing dashboard lag. Analysis reveals:
- Backend `getTrendData` procedure performs multiple separate database queries and client-side data processing
- Frontend component lacks memoization, causing unnecessary re-renders
- Date formatting operations happen on every render without caching
- No response caching, resulting in expensive database aggregations on each request
This story integrates performance optimization alongside new feature development to address these issues.

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Dashboard analytics will use existing models (Products, Sales, Repairs, Customers) to calculate and display new metrics. All calculations are derived from existing database tables without schema changes. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no dashboard-specific schema changes specified]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required at the REST level. Dashboard enhancements will extend existing tRPC procedures to provide additional analytics data. The existing dashboard tRPC router will be enhanced with new procedures for:
- Stock value calculations from existing Product data
- Recent activities aggregation from existing transaction data
- Top products analysis from existing Sales data
- Low stock alerts from existing Product stock levels
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - no new REST endpoints specified for dashboard analytics]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**New Components to Create:**
1. `/components/charts/IncomeExpenseChart.tsx` - Client component using Recharts for Line Chart (FR24)
2. `/components/charts/TopProductsChart.tsx` - Client component using Recharts for Bar Chart (FR26)
3. `/components/dashboard/RecentActivities.tsx` - Component for latest system activities (FR25)
4. `/components/dashboard/LowStockAlerts.tsx` - Component for low stock alerts (FR27)

**Existing Component to Modify:**
- `/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Add new charts/widgets to existing dashboard layout

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Recharts library (^2.12.7) for interactive charts
- Charts must be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Components must integrate with existing time period filtering
- Follow existing dashboard card styling patterns

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- Primary file to modify: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` (add new components to existing layout)
- New chart components: `src/components/charts/` folder (create if needed)
- New dashboard widgets: `src/components/dashboard/` folder (create if needed)
- Existing TrendGraph component at: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/components/TrendGraph.tsx` (reference for patterns)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New UI components (Charts, Dashboard widgets) using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, data rendering, and responsive design
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test chart components render correctly with mock data
  - Test dashboard widgets handle loading and error states
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Test integration with existing time period filtering
  - Regression testing to ensure existing dashboard functionality remains intact

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **Required Dependency**: Recharts ^2.12.7 for charting components
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC)
- Follow existing component patterns from current dashboard
- Maintain consistency with existing card styling and layout
- Currency formatting must use Thai Baht (฿) symbols
- Components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- **Performance Requirements**: TrendGraph load time must improve by at least 50%
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement 5-minute TTL caching for dashboard analytics data
- **Optimization Approach**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations

### Project Structure Notes
This enhancement aligns with the existing project structure and follows the architectural pattern of creating new components in dedicated folders. The new charts and dashboard widgets will be properly organized in separate folders as specified in the architecture documents. All new components will integrate into the existing dashboard page without requiring major structural changes.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Focus on component behavior and data rendering testing
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on new chart and widget components
- **Manual Testing**: Full regression test to ensure dashboard enhancements don't break existing functionality
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test chart components with various data scenarios
  - Test responsive design across mobile and desktop
  - Test loading states and error handling
  - Test integration with existing time period filters
  - Test Thai Baht currency formatting in new components
  - **Performance Testing**: Verify TrendGraph optimization meets 50% improvement target
  - Test React.memo effectiveness in preventing unnecessary re-renders
  - Test caching behavior and TTL expiration
