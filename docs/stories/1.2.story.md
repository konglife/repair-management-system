# Story 1.2: User Authentication Setup

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application,
**so that** my data is secure and I have a personal session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A user can create a new account.
2. A registered user can log in with their credentials.
3. A logged-in user can log out.
4. Unauthenticated users cannot access pages that require a login.
5. The authentication system is connected to an external service, such as Clerk, as specified in the Technical Assumptions.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]
- Next.js 15.4.6 project is set up with TypeScript and all dependencies
- tRPC v11.4.x is configured and working properly
- Project structure follows unified architecture specifications
- Basic homepage exists at src/app/page.tsx ready for authentication integration
- All development tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.) are configured

### Authentication System Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-external-apis.md]
- **Authentication Service**: Clerk for user authentication and management
- **SDK**: Use @clerk/nextjs official SDK (not REST API directly)
- **Key Components**: 
  - `<SignIn />`, `<SignUp />`, `<UserButton />` for UI
  - `useUser()`, `useAuth()` hooks for user data
  - `authMiddleware()` for protecting tRPC API routes
- **API Keys**: Publishable Key and Secret Key stored in .env file
- **Integration**: Clerk middleware inspects all requests to Backend API for authorization

### Tech Stack Integration
[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack-updated-versions-august-2025.md]
- **Authentication**: Clerk (Latest Stable version)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.x with TypeScript 5.9.x
- **API Protection**: tRPC 11.4.x with protectedProcedure
- **Security**: Environment variables in .env, no secrets in frontend

### Authentication Workflow
[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
1. User visits website
2. Frontend tries to fetch protected data
3. Backend responds "Unauthorized" 
4. Frontend displays Clerk login page
5. User enters credentials to Clerk
6. Clerk sends session token to frontend
7. Frontend makes API calls with session token
8. Backend verifies token with Clerk
9. Clerk validates token
10. Backend sends requested data
11. Frontend displays authenticated content

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]
- **Auth pages**: `src/app/(auth)/` - Group for authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- **Protected pages**: `src/app/(main)/` - Group for main app pages after login
- **Auth configuration**: `src/server/auth.ts` - Authentication configurations
- **Environment file**: `.env` - Store Clerk API keys securely
- **Route groups**: Use Next.js route groups for organizing auth vs main app pages

### Security Implementation
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
- **Authorization**: All sensitive API routes protected by tRPC's `protectedProcedure`
- **Session Management**: Handled entirely by Clerk
- **Input Validation**: All API data validated with Zod within tRPC
- **Secret Management**: API keys in .env file, never exposed in frontend code

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure:
- Clerk middleware: `middleware.ts` (project root)
- Auth configuration: `src/server/auth.ts`
- Sign-in page: `src/app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
- Sign-up page: `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`
- Updated homepage: `src/app/page.tsx`
- Environment variables: `.env`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
- **Framework**: Jest v30.0.x and React Testing Library (included with Next.js)
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` pattern
- **Requirements**: 
  - Test authentication state changes
  - Test route protection functionality
  - Test sign-in/sign-up page rendering
  - Test logout functionality
- **Standards**: Follow Testing Pyramid approach - focus on unit tests

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Clerk's latest stable version
- All API routes must use tRPC's protectedProcedure for sensitive data
- Environment variables must be properly configured
- Route protection must prevent unauthorized access
- Integration must follow Clerk's Next.js best practices

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/11-implementation-development-standards.md]
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source files using `*.test.ts` pattern
- **Framework**: Jest v30.0.x and React Testing Library (comes with Next.js)
- **Standards**: Follow Testing Pyramid approach - primarily unit tests
- **Requirements**: 
  - Test authentication state management and hooks
  - Test route protection middleware behavior
  - Test sign-in/sign-up page component rendering
  - Test logout functionality and redirect behavior
  - Critical authentication logic must have unit tests
- **Commands**: Standard Jest commands integrated with Next.js
