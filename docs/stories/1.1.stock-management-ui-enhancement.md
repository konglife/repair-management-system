# Story 1.1: Stock Management UI Enhancement

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** repair shop manager,
**I want** an improved Stock Management interface with reordered navigation, searchable product selection, and date flexibility,
**so that** I can navigate more intuitively and record transactions more efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The submenu in "Stock Management" must be reordered to: Products, Record Purchase, Categories, Units (FR1.1)
2. The "Products" page must be the default view when navigating to "Stock Management" (FR1.2)  
3. In "Record New Purchase" form, the "Product" field must be a searchable dropdown (FR1.3)
4. The "Record New Purchase" form must include a "Date" field for past date selection (FR1.4)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Reorder Stock Management navigation tabs (AC: 1)
  - [x] Update tab order in stock page component from current order to: products → purchases → categories → units
  - [x] Verify tab switching functionality maintains state
- [x] Task 2: Set Products as default view (AC: 2)  
  - [x] Change initial state from "categories" to "products"
  - [x] Test default navigation behavior
- [x] Task 3: Implement searchable product dropdown (AC: 3)
  - [x] Replace standard select with ProductAutocomplete component in purchase form
  - [x] Ensure proper product filtering and selection
  - [x] Maintain existing form validation
- [x] Task 4: Add date field to Record Purchase form (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement date picker using Shadcn UI Calendar and Popover
  - [x] Update PurchaseRecord creation to accept custom dates
  - [x] Add form validation for date field
- [x] Task 5: Testing
  - [x] Unit tests for navigation reordering
  - [x] Component tests for searchable dropdown behavior  
  - [x] Form validation tests for date picker
  - [x] Integration tests for purchase form submission

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous insights available.

### Data Models
**Product Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:32-51]:
- Contains `id`, `name`, `salePrice`, `quantity`, `averageCost`
- Relations to `Category`, `Unit`, `PurchaseRecord[]`, `SaleItem[]`, `UsedPart[]`

**PurchaseRecord Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:54-65]:
- Contains `id`, `quantity`, `costPerUnit`, `purchaseDate`, linked to products
- `purchaseDate` field supports custom date selection (DateTime type)

**Category Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:14-20]:
- Simple `id` and `name` structure with one-to-many relation to products

**Unit Model** [Source: prisma/schema.prisma:23-29]:
- Simple `id` and `name` structure with one-to-many relation to products

### Component Specifications
**Existing Components to Leverage** [Source: current codebase]:
- `ProductAutocomplete` (src/components/ui/ProductAutocomplete.tsx): Searchable dropdown with stock filtering - use this for FR1.3
- `SearchInput` (src/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx): Debounced search with clear functionality
- Shadcn UI components: Button, Card, Dialog, Calendar, Popover for date picker implementation

**UI Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture.md:32-40]:
- Use Shadcn UI `<Combobox>` component pattern for searchable dropdown (FR1.3)
- Implement date picker using Shadcn UI `<Calendar>` and `<Popover>` components (FR1.4)

### File Locations
**Primary File to Modify** [Source: current codebase structure]:
- `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` - Main stock management page containing:
  - Tab navigation (lines 459-492) - needs reordering for FR1.1
  - Initial state (line 16) - change from "categories" to "products" for FR1.2
  - Purchase form (lines 1054-1065) - replace standard select for FR1.3, add date field for FR1.4

**Component Structure**:
```
src/
├── app/(main)/stock/
│   └── page.tsx                    # Main modifications needed here
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── ProductAutocomplete.tsx # Existing component to use
│   │   └── [shadcn-ui-components]  # Calendar, Popover for date picker
```

### Technical Constraints
**Current Implementation Patterns** [Source: current codebase]:
- Uses tRPC for type-safe API calls
- Component-level state with `useState`
- Manual refetch calls after mutations
- TypeScript with proper interface definitions
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling

**State Management** [Source: docs/architecture.md:24-30]:
- Architecture recommends SWR or TanStack Query for automatic revalidation
- Should maintain existing patterns for consistency in this story

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Framework** [Source: package.json, SearchInput.test.tsx]:
- Jest with React Testing Library
- Follow existing patterns from SearchInput.test.tsx:
  - Mock timers for debounce testing
  - Accessibility testing with ARIA attributes
  - User interaction testing (fireEvent, waitFor)
  - Custom props and className testing

**Test Coverage Required**:
- Tab navigation reordering functionality
- Default view loading (Products tab)
- Searchable dropdown behavior in purchase forms
- Date field functionality and validation
- Form submission with custom dates

### Testing
**Test File Location** [Source: current codebase structure]:
- Create/update tests in same directory as components being modified
- Follow pattern: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.test.tsx` for main component tests
- Component-specific tests alongside respective component files

**Test Standards** [Source: existing test files]:
- Use Jest with React Testing Library
- Include accessibility testing with proper ARIA attributes
- Test user interactions comprehensively
- Mock external dependencies (tRPC calls, timers)
- Ensure responsive behavior testing

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns**:
- Jest for test runner and assertions
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock timers for debounced functionality
- fireEvent and waitFor for async interactions
- Custom render functions for consistent test setup

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story**:
- Navigation tab reordering: Verify correct tab order and default selection
- Searchable dropdown: Test product filtering, selection, and accessibility
- Date picker: Test date selection, validation, and form submission
- Form integration: Ensure all fields work together correctly
- Regression testing: Verify existing functionality remains intact
