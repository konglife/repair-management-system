# Story 5.2: Display Summary Cards on Dashboard

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to see key business metrics in summary cards on the Dashboard,
**so that** I can quickly understand the current state of my business.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Dashboard is the first page displayed after the user logs in.
2. This page calls the Dashboard Data API to fetch data for display.
3. There is an option (e.g., Dropdown) to change the time range for the summary ("Today", "Last 7 Days", "This Month").
4. Five summary cards clearly display data from the API (Expenses, Repair Income, Sales Income, Sales Profit, Repair Profit).
5. When the user changes the time range, all data on the cards must be updated accordingly.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 5.1 completion notes]
- Dashboard tRPC API is fully implemented and tested with getSummary and getTrendData procedures
- Data structure is established and type-safe: `{ totalExpenses, totalRepairIncome, totalSalesIncome, salesProfit, repairProfit }`
- Time range enum is established: `['today', 'last7days', 'thismonth']`
- Authentication is enforced via protectedProcedure pattern
- tRPC client setup is ready for frontend consumption via established patterns

### Data Models and API Integration
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md + Story 5.1 implementation]

**Dashboard API Integration**:
- **API Endpoint**: Use `api.dashboard.getSummary.useQuery()` from tRPC client
- **Input Parameter**: `{ period: 'today' | 'last7days' | 'thismonth' }`
- **Response Type**: 
```typescript
{
  totalExpenses: number,      // From PurchaseRecord aggregation
  totalRepairIncome: number,  // From Repair.totalCost aggregation  
  totalSalesIncome: number,   // From Sale.totalAmount aggregation
  salesProfit: number,        // From Sale: totalAmount - totalCost
  repairProfit: number        // From Repair.laborCost aggregation
}
```

**Time Range Mapping**:
- "Today" → `'today'`
- "Last 7 Days" → `'last7days'` 
- "This Month" → `'thismonth'`
