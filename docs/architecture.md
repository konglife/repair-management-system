# **Repair Management System Brownfield Enhancement Architecture (V2.3.0)**

## **1. Introduction**

This document serves as an addendum to the existing v2.2.0 architecture (In the folder: docs_archive) for the v2.3.0 enhancement. Its purpose is to confirm that no new architectural patterns or significant structural changes are required.

## **2. Architectural Decision**

The enhancements defined in the `prd.md` for v2.3.0 consist of:
1.  **UI Interaction Refactoring:** Applying the existing tRPC `mutation` and `utils.invalidate()` pattern (as seen in the Stock Management module) to the Sales and Customers modules.
2.  **Report UI Adjustments:** Minor modifications to the presentation layer of the Summary Report.

These changes are considered implementation-level refinements that adhere to the established architectural patterns of the application. The existing component structure, tRPC API design, and database schema remain unchanged.

**Conclusion:** All development for v2.3.0 will proceed under the guidance of the existing v2.2.0 architecture documentation. No new, dedicated architecture document is necessary.
