# User Interface Enhancement Goals

- **Overview Section Redesign**: The "Overview" display at the top of the report will be completely redesigned. It will move from a simple text list to a more structured, document-like layout using elements like cards, icons, and improved typography to enhance clarity and professional appearance.
- **Enhanced Data Tables**: The "Sales Details" and "Repair Details" tables will be updated to include new columns that provide immediate context about the items involved.
- **New Purchase Table**: A new "Purchase Details" table will be introduced, styled consistently with the other tables.
- **Total Row Implementation**: A summary "Total" row will be added to the bottom of all three tables to provide quick financial summaries for each category.
