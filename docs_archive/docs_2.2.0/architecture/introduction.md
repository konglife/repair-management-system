# **Introduction**

### **Document Purpose**

This document outlines the technical architecture for the v2.2.0 enhancement of the Repair Management System. It provides a detailed plan for modifying the existing backend and frontend components to deliver the improved `/reports/summary` page, ensuring seamless integration with the current system. This plan is based on the provided `prd.md` and `ui-ux-specification.md`.

### **Existing Project Analysis**

The existing system is a robust Next.js application using tRPC for API communication and Prisma as the ORM. The target for this enhancement, the `reports.ts` tRPC router and the `ReportView.tsx` component, are well-structured. The Prisma schema already contains the necessary relations between `Sale`, `Repair`, `Product`, and `PurchaseRecord` models to facilitate the required data fetching. No architectural changes are needed for the database schema itself.
