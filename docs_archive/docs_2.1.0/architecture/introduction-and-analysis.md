# Introduction and Analysis

### Enhancement Overview
This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the report generation feature within the **Repair Management System**. The primary objective is to pivot from the previous plan of PDF generation. The new goal is to remove all legacy PDF-generation logic (`pdf-lib`) and implement a new feature that displays the summary report on a dedicated web page within the application, rendered from an HTML/CSS template.

### Analysis of Current Architecture (V2.0.0)
A review of the existing project reveals:
* **Structure**: A full-stack application built with Next.js (App Router) utilizing tRPC for the API layer.
* **Database**: Prisma is used as the ORM for managing the PostgreSQL database.
* **Legacy Report System**: The system includes a `reports.ts` tRPC router for fetching summary data and a `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts` utility that will be removed.

### Compatibility Requirements
* **Data Logic**: The new architecture must not alter the data-fetching logic of the existing `reports.getMonthlySummary` tRPC router.
* **UI**: The `/reports` page will be modified to navigate to the new report page instead of triggering a file download.
