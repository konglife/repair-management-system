# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

The current project (v2.0.0) is a full-stack application for managing a repair and sales business, built with Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS. The existing `reports` page allows users to select a date range but currently lacks a dedicated view for the generated summary.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- [x] Major Feature Modification

#### Enhancement Description
This enhancement will introduce a new feature where generating a report no longer creates a PDF file. Instead, it will navigate the user to a new, dedicated web page that displays the summary report directly in the browser. This report page will be styled according to a provided HTML template. All previous PDF-generation logic will be removed.

#### Impact Assessment
- [x] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- To provide users with an immediate, in-app view of their business summary report without needing to download a file.
- To create a report view with a flexible and aesthetically pleasing layout, similar to a well-designed web page.
- To simplify the technical architecture by removing the complexities of server-side PDF generation.
- To completely remove the `pdf-lib` dependency and all related code from the project.

#### Background Context
The previous goal of generating a PDF proved to be overly complex for the immediate need. A direct, in-browser report page offers a more streamlined user experience and significantly simplifies the development and maintenance workflow. This pivot allows for faster delivery of the core feature: viewing a formatted business summary.
