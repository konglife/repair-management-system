## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 3.2 completion notes]
- Customer CRUD infrastructure is fully established with working create, getAll, and update procedures
- Customer data model and Prisma schema are implemented and tested
- tRPC customer router exists at `src/server/api/routers/customer.ts` and is integrated into main appRouter
- Customer UI components follow established patterns using Shadcn/ui components (Table, Dialog, Button, etc.)
- Responsive customer list page exists at `src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` with full CRUD functionality
- Testing patterns are established with Jest and React Testing Library for both router and UI components
- Build pipeline is clean with zero TypeScript errors and working customer management functionality

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#customer + architecture/4-data-models.md#sale + architecture/4-data-models.md#repair]

**Customer Model**: Already implemented with all required fields
- `id: String` (unique CUID - for retrieving transaction history)
- `name: String` (required - display in details page)
- `phone: String?` (optional - display in details page)
- `address: String?` (optional - display in details page)
- `createdAt: DateTime` (auto-generated)

**Sale Model**: Transaction history data structure
- `id: String` (unique CUID)
- `customerId: String` (foreign key to Customer)
- `totalAmount: Float` (display in sales history)
- `totalCost: Float` (for profit calculations if needed)
- `createdAt: DateTime` (display as sale date)
- **Relationships**: One Sale belongs to one Customer, One Sale has many SaleItems

**Repair Model**: Transaction history data structure
- `id: String` (unique CUID)
- `customerId: String` (foreign key to Customer)
- `description: String` (display in repairs history)
- `totalCost: Float` (display as repair cost)
- `partsCost: Float` (for detailed breakdown if needed)
- `laborCost: Float` (for detailed breakdown if needed)
- `createdAt: DateTime` (display as repair date)
- **Relationships**: One Repair belongs to one Customer, One Repair has many UsedParts

[Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#customer + architecture/9-database-schema.md#sale + architecture/9-database-schema.md#repair]
- **Prisma Relationships**: Customer model has `sales Sale[]` and `repairs Repair[]` relations already defined
- **Query Operations**: Use Prisma's `include` to fetch related sales and repairs: 
  ```typescript
  prisma.customer.findUnique({ 
    where: { id }, 
    include: { 
      sales: { include: { saleItems: true } }, 
      repairs: { include: { usedParts: true } } 
    } 
  })
  ```
