# 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* Reduce the time spent on daily/monthly accounting and stock summarization by at least 90%.
* Increase the accuracy of stock and financial data to 100%.
* Users can view the correct remaining stock balance within 5 seconds.
* Users can record a new sale or repair job within 1 minute.
* Users can view the current month's income-expense summary instantly from the Dashboard.

### Background Context

This project aims to solve the operational problems of a small repair shop that relies on manual bookkeeping. Currently, processes ranging from sales, repairs, stock management, and financial summaries are all manual, which is time-consuming and carries a risk of errors.

This Back-Office system will be built to replace these processes. It will help reduce time spent on paperwork, increase data accuracy, and present summary data through an easy-to-understand Dashboard to improve business decision-making.
