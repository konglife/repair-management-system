# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience (UX) should be clean, straightforward, and efficient. The design will prioritize clarity over complex aesthetics to allow a single user to learn and use the system with minimal guidance. The goal is to make daily data entry a quick and non-tedious task.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* Use standard CRUD forms for data entry (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Data will be displayed in sortable tables.
* The Dashboard will use simple cards and graphs to display summary information.
* Navigation will use a persistent main menu on the side (Sidebar).

### Core Screens and Views

As we've concluded, the main screen structure of the system will be as follows:
* Dashboard (Overview page)
* Stock Management
* Sales
* Repairs
* Customers

### Accessibility

* **Assumption:** For this first version (MVP), there will be no formal targeting of web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), but the design will adhere to best practices for readability and ease of use.

### Branding

* **Assumption:** No specific Brand Guideline has been defined yet. The design will use a clean, modern, and neutral color palette.

### Target Device and Platforms

The application will be a Responsive Web App, designed for optimal use on a Desktop Browser, but core functions will still be usable via Tablet or Mobile.
