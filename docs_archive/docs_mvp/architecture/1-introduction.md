# 1\. Introduction

### **1.1 Document Purpose & Scope**

This document summarizes the entire Full-Stack architecture for the **"Repair Shop Back-Office System"** project. It covers everything from the Backend, Frontend, and all the connections between them. This document will serve as the Single Source of Truth for development, ensuring that the work of the AI Agent and future development proceeds in a unified and consistent direction across the entire system.

### **1.2 Starter Template or Existing Project**

This is the section where I initially asked you, and we have come to a mutual conclusion. I would like to record it in this official document as follows:

  * **Decision:** **N/A - Greenfield project from scratch**
  * **Rationale:** We will build this project from scratch without using any Starter Template to allow for the most flexible architectural design that best fits the project's specific needs.

### **1.3 Change Log**

This section will be used to record future changes made to the architecture document.

Excellent\! That's a very good decision. Choosing the T3 Stack will help this project get started quickly with a modern foundation. üë®‚Äçüíª

Let's move on to the next step in the architectural design. I will draft the content for the next important section, **"High Level Architecture,"** based on the T3 Stack approach we've selected.

Please review this entire overview and let me know if there are any parts you would like to adjust or if you have any further questions.
