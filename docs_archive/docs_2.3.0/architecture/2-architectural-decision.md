# **2. Architectural Decision**

The enhancements defined in the `prd.md` for v2.3.0 consist of:
1.  **UI Interaction Refactoring:** Applying the existing tRPC `mutation` and `utils.invalidate()` pattern (as seen in the Stock Management module) to the Sales and Customers modules.
2.  **Report UI Adjustments:** Minor modifications to the presentation layer of the Summary Report.

These changes are considered implementation-level refinements that adhere to the established architectural patterns of the application. The existing component structure, tRPC API design, and database schema remain unchanged.

**Conclusion:** All development for v2.3.0 will proceed under the guidance of the existing v2.2.0 architecture documentation. No new, dedicated architecture document is necessary.
