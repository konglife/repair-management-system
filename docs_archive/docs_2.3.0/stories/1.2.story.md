# Story 1.2: Refine UI of the Summary Report

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the summary report to be clean and easy to read,
**so that** I can quickly understand the business performance data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Parts Used" column in the "Details from Repairs" table displays only the part name and quantity (e.g., "Screen x1").
2. The date range in the report header is formatted with a hyphen (e.g., "Summary Report 01/08/2025 - 31/08/2025").

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Update Parts Used Column Display Format (AC: 1)
  - [x] Modify RepairsTable.tsx to display parts as "name x quantity" format only
  - [x] Remove cost display from parts used column (keep in separate cost columns)
  - [x] Update parts formatting logic to use quantity if available
  - [x] Test new formatting with mock data

- [x] Task 2: Update Report Header Date Format (AC: 2)
  - [x] Modify ReportHeader.tsx to use hyphen separator instead of "to"
  - [x] Ensure formatReportDate maintains DD/MM/YYYY format but change connector
  - [x] Test header formatting with various date ranges

- [x] Task 3: Unit Testing (AC: All)
  - [x] Update RepairsTable.test.tsx to verify new parts formatting
  - [x] Update ReportHeader.test.tsx to verify hyphen date format
  - [x] Add test cases for edge cases (no parts, missing quantities)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established successful patterns for:
- Using utils.invalidate() for data refresh 
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Following existing project patterns and testing frameworks
- No major technical blockers were encountered

### Data Models
The story works with existing report data structures:
- **RepairsData** [Source: src/components/reports/ReportView.tsx:58-83]: Contains usedParts array with name and costAtTime
- **UsedParts** [Source: src/components/reports/RepairsTable.tsx:45-50]: Currently displays as "name (cost)" format
- **ReportPeriod** [Source: src/components/reports/ReportView.tsx:13-16]: Contains startDate and endDate

### Component Specifications
- **RepairsTable Component** [Source: src/components/reports/RepairsTable.tsx]: Located at line 45-50, currently formats parts as `${part.name} (${formatCurrency(part.costAtTime)})` - needs to change to `${part.name} x${quantity}` format
- **ReportHeader Component** [Source: src/components/reports/ReportHeader.tsx:14-16]: Currently uses "to" separator between dates - needs hyphen separator
- **formatReportDate Function** [Source: src/lib/utils.ts:54-56]: Provides DD/MM/YYYY formatting, used in header

### File Locations
Based on project structure:
- RepairsTable: `src/components/reports/RepairsTable.tsx`
- ReportHeader: `src/components/reports/ReportHeader.tsx`
- Test files: `src/components/reports/RepairsTable.test.tsx` and `src/components/reports/ReportHeader.test.tsx`
- Utils: `src/lib/utils.ts` (for date formatting utilities)

### Technical Constraints
- **React/TypeScript**: Maintain existing component patterns [Source: Architecture v2.2.0]
- **Styling**: Continue using Tailwind CSS classes for consistency [Source: Current components]
- **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript interfaces and props validation [Source: Current components use type imports]
- **No Breaking Changes**: Changes are UI-only, no API modifications needed [Source: Architecture v2.2.0 - "Report UI Adjustments"]

### Testing
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **Test Location**: Alongside component files as `.test.tsx` files [Source: existing test structure]
- **Test Strategy**: Component tests for UI rendering and formatting logic [Source: CLAUDE.md]
- **Coverage Requirements**: Focus on formatting logic and edge cases
