# Story 2.2: Enhance Sales Module

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the Sales module to have better analytics (date filters, new cards) and an autocomplete product search in the sales form,
**so that** I can process sales more efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a date range filter (`Today`, `Last 7 Days`, `Last 1 Month`) to the sales analytics cards (FR11)
2. Convert the "Product" field in the "Create New Sale" form into an autocomplete search input (FR12)
3. Add three new analytics cards: "Average Sale Value", "Top Selling Product", and "Total Transactions" (FR13)
4. Ensure all currency values display in Thai Baht (฿) format (existing FR10 compliance)
5. Maintain existing sales functionality and data table search
6. Add proper loading states and error handling for all new components
7. Ensure responsive design works on mobile and desktop
8. All new analytics cards must respect the selected date range filter
9. Autocomplete search must be debounced and provide real-time product filtering
10. Form validation must work correctly with the new autocomplete product selection

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1:
- Successfully enhanced dashboard analytics with new cards and date filtering
- Pattern of creating analytics cards and integrating date range filtering works well
- Backend tRPC procedure enhancement pattern for analytics data established
- Frontend component patterns for responsive analytics cards proven effective
- Performance optimization considerations important for analytics queries
- Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting patterns already established

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Sales analytics will use existing models (Sales, Products, Customers) to calculate and display new metrics. All calculations are derived from existing database tables without schema changes. Autocomplete search will use existing Product model data. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no sales-specific schema changes specified]

### API Specifications  
No new API endpoints required at the REST level. Sales enhancements will extend existing tRPC procedures to provide additional analytics data and date filtering capabilities. The existing sales tRPC router will be enhanced with:
- Date range filtering parameters for existing analytics procedures
- New procedures for Average Sale Value, Top Selling Product, Total Transactions calculations
- Enhanced product search capabilities for autocomplete functionality
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - no new REST endpoints specified for sales analytics]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**Existing Components to Modify:**
- `/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx` - Add date range filter, new analytics cards, and convert product selection to autocomplete

**New Components Pattern:**
- Follow existing analytics card pattern from current Sales page (lines 184-220)
- Use established SearchInput component pattern from `/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` for autocomplete functionality
- Apply date range filtering pattern similar to dashboard implementation

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use existing SearchInput component with debouncing (300ms default) for autocomplete
- Apply existing analytics card styling patterns for consistency
- Ensure responsive design using existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- Convert existing Select component to SearchInput-based autocomplete for product selection

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- Primary file to modify: `src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx` (add date filter, new cards, autocomplete)
- Autocomplete search: Use existing `/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` component
- Analytics pattern: Follow existing card pattern in Sales page
- API enhancement: `src/server/api/routers/sale.ts` (add date filtering and new analytics procedures)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New analytics card components and autocomplete functionality using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library (established pattern)
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, data rendering, and user interactions
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test analytics cards render correctly with filtered data
  - Test autocomplete search functionality with product filtering and debouncing
  - Test date range filter integration with analytics cards
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Test form validation with new autocomplete product selection
  - Regression testing to ensure existing sales functionality remains intact

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **Existing Dependencies**: Use established SearchInput component and react-number-format ^5.3.4 for currency inputs
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC)
- Follow existing component patterns from current Sales page
- Maintain consistency with existing analytics card styling
- Currency formatting must use Thai Baht (฿) symbols (existing FR10 compliance)
- Components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- **Debouncing**: SearchInput component provides 300ms debouncing for autocomplete
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient database queries with proper date filtering and indexing

### Project Structure Notes
This enhancement aligns with the existing project structure and follows the established pattern of extending existing pages with new functionality. The Sales page enhancement will leverage existing UI components (SearchInput, analytics cards) and extend existing tRPC procedures rather than creating entirely new structure. All new functionality will integrate into the existing `/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx` without requiring major architectural changes.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Co-located test files following established patterns
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on new analytics cards and autocomplete functionality
- **Manual Testing**: Full regression test to ensure sales enhancements don't break existing functionality
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test analytics cards with various date range filters
  - Test autocomplete search with different product scenarios
  - Test responsive design across mobile and desktop
  - Test loading states and error handling
  - Test Thai Baht currency formatting in new components
  - Test form submission with autocomplete product selection
  - Test existing sales table and search functionality remains intact
