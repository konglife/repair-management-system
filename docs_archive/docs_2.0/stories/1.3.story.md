# Story 1.3: Implement Universal Search

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a search bar on all main data tables (Stock, Sales, Repairs, Customers),
**so that** I can quickly find the information I need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a search bar to the Stock page that filters products by name, description, or category
2. Add a search bar to the Sales page that filters sales by date, customer name, or total amount
3. Add a search bar to the Repairs page that filters repairs by customer name, device, or status
4. Add a search bar to the Customers page that filters customers by name, email, or phone
5. Search should be real-time (filter as you type) and case-insensitive
6. Search functionality should be consistent across all modules

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2:
- Successfully used utility functions for consistent implementation across components
- Creating reusable functions in src/lib/utils.ts is a good pattern to follow
- Comprehensive testing strategy should be applied
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding enhancements
- Pattern of creating reusable UI components in src/components/ui/ directory works well

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. The search functionality will work with existing data structures for Products, Sales, Repairs, and Customers. All filtering will be performed on existing data retrieved from the database. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no search-related schema changes specified]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required for this story. The search functionality will be implemented as client-side filtering of data that is already being fetched by existing API calls. This approach provides real-time search without additional server requests. [Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - SearchInput component specified as frontend-only]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md]
- **`/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx`**: A reusable search bar component to be implemented on various data tables (FR1, FR9, FR14, FR20)
- Component should be consistent with existing UI components in src/components/ui/ directory
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing table layouts across all modules

[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- **SearchInput.tsx**: Should be created in `src/components/ui/` directory alongside other reusable UI components
- Component should follow existing naming conventions and patterns from other UI components

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- SearchInput component: `src/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx`
- SearchInput tests: `src/components/ui/SearchInput.test.tsx` (co-located with component)
- Modifications needed to existing page files:
  - `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` 
  - `src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` (when customers module exists)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New UI components (SearchInput) should have unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components
- **Manual Testing**: A full regression test must be performed to ensure that adding search bars does not break existing CRUD functionalities in Stock, Sales, and Repairs modules
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test SearchInput component functionality and user interactions
  - Test real-time filtering behavior
  - Test case-insensitive search across all modules
  - Verify accessibility compliance

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- No additional dependencies specified for search functionality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions from the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing UI components in src/components/ui/

### Project Structure Notes
The SearchInput component implementation aligns perfectly with the existing project structure. The component will be placed in `src/components/ui/` alongside other reusable UI components like button.tsx, input.tsx, etc. No new folders or architectural changes are required. All search functionality integrates with existing page structures without disruption.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components (e.g., `src/components/ui/SearchInput.test.tsx`)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, user interactions, and integration with pages
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test SearchInput component with various input scenarios
  - Test debounced input behavior to ensure performance
  - Test search functionality integration on each page
  - Test accessibility features (screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)
  - Regression testing to ensure existing functionality remains intact
  - Test real-time filtering performance with large datasets
