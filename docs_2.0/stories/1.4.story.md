# Story 1.4: Enhance Numeric Inputs

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** numeric input fields for currency to be user-friendly, with automatic formatting and a mobile-friendly keypad,
**so that** I can reduce errors and save time when entering currency values.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement input masking for automatic thousand-separator commas in currency fields
2. Set the input mode to display a numeric keypad (numpad) on mobile devices for currency fields
3. Apply these enhancements to Stock module currency input fields (FR3)
   - Sale price input in Create New Product form
   - Edit price input in inline product editing
   - Cost per unit input in Record Purchase form
4. Apply these enhancements to Repairs module currency input fields (FR16)
   - Total repair cost input in Create New Repair Job form
5. Apply these enhancements to Sales module currency-related numeric inputs
   - Quantity inputs that affect currency calculations
6. Apply these enhancements to any other currency input fields found in the Dashboard or other modules
7. Maintain existing functionality while enhancing user experience
8. Ensure currency formatting is consistent with Thai Baht (฿) formatting standards
9. Create a reusable CurrencyInput component that can be applied system-wide for consistency

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3:
- Successfully used utility functions for consistent implementation across components
- Creating reusable functions in src/lib/utils.ts is a good pattern to follow
- Comprehensive testing strategy should be applied
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while adding enhancements
- Pattern of creating reusable UI components in src/components/ui/ directory works well

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. The CurrencyInput component will handle currency formatting and input masking without requiring database schema changes. All currency values will continue to be stored as existing numeric types in the database. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no currency input related schema changes specified]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required for this story. The CurrencyInput component will be implemented as a frontend-only enhancement that formats user input before submission through existing API calls. All backend APIs will continue to receive numeric values as they currently do. [Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - CurrencyInput specified as UI component only]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md]
- **`/components/ui/CurrencyInput.tsx`**: A reusable input component using `react-number-format` for currency fields (FR3, FR16)
- Component should be consistent with existing UI components in src/components/ui/ directory
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing forms across ALL modules (Stock, Sales, Repairs, Dashboard)
- Must support both pure currency inputs and numeric inputs that affect currency calculations
- Should handle decimal precision for currency values (step="0.01")
- Must maintain existing input props like min, max, placeholder, disabled, etc.

[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- **CurrencyInput.tsx**: Should be created in `src/components/ui/` directory alongside other reusable UI components
- Must be designed for easy drop-in replacement of existing number inputs

### Library Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **UI Input Mask**: `react-number-format` version ^5.3.4 - To provide user-friendly, masked input fields for currency, improving UX and data accuracy

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md and codebase analysis]
- CurrencyInput component: `src/components/ui/CurrencyInput.tsx`
- CurrencyInput tests: `src/components/ui/CurrencyInput.test.tsx` (co-located with component)
- Modifications needed to existing form files:
  - `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` (Create Product form, Record Purchase form, inline editing)
  - `src/app/(main)/sales/page.tsx` (Create Sale form quantity inputs)
  - `src/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` (Create Repair Job form, total cost input)
  - `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` (any currency input fields if present)
- Files identified with specific currency input fields:
  - Stock: Sale price input (line ~815), Edit price input (line ~960), Cost per unit input (line ~1060)
  - Sales: Quantity inputs affecting price calculations (lines ~348, ~380)
  - Repairs: Total repair cost input (line ~450), Parts quantity inputs (lines ~383, ~415)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New UI components (CurrencyInput) should have unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components
- **Manual Testing**: A full regression test must be performed to ensure that adding currency input enhancements does not break existing CRUD functionalities in ALL modules (Stock, Sales, Repairs, Dashboard)
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test CurrencyInput component functionality and user interactions
  - Test input masking and thousand-separator formatting
  - Test mobile numeric keypad input mode
  - Test integration with existing forms across all modules
  - Test both currency and numeric input modes
  - Verify accessibility compliance
  - Test end-to-end currency calculation workflows

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Add react-number-format library version ^5.3.4 for input masking functionality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions from the codebase
- Maintain consistency with existing UI components in src/components/ui/

### Project Structure Notes
The CurrencyInput component implementation aligns perfectly with the existing project structure. The component will be placed in `src/components/ui/` alongside other reusable UI components like SearchInput.tsx, button.tsx, input.tsx, etc. No new folders or architectural changes are required. The component will integrate with existing forms across ALL modules (Stock, Sales, Repairs, Dashboard) without structural disruption. The system-wide approach ensures consistent user experience for all currency and numeric inputs throughout the application.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components (e.g., `src/components/ui/CurrencyInput.test.tsx`)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, user interactions, and integration with forms across ALL modules
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test CurrencyInput component with various currency input scenarios
  - Test input masking and formatting behavior
  - Test mobile numeric keypad functionality
  - Test accessibility features (screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation)
  - Regression testing to ensure existing functionality remains intact across Stock, Sales, Repairs, and Dashboard modules
  - Test form integration and value handling system-wide
  - Test both currency and numeric input modes
  - End-to-end testing of currency calculation workflows
