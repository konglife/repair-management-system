# Story 2.3: Enhance Repairs Module

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the Repairs module to have better analytics (date filters, cost card) and an autocomplete parts search in the repair form,
**so that** I can manage repair jobs more effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Add a date range filter (`Today`, `Last 7 Days`, `Last 1 Month`) to the repair analytics cards (FR17)
2. Convert the "Add Parts Used" field in the "Create New Repair Job" form into an autocomplete search input (FR18)
3. Add one new analytics card: "Total Parts Cost" (FR19)
4. Ensure all currency values display in Thai Baht (฿) format (existing FR15 compliance)
5. Maintain existing repairs functionality and data table search
6. Add proper loading states and error handling for all new components
7. Ensure responsive design works on mobile and desktop
8. All new analytics cards must respect the selected date range filter
9. Autocomplete search must be debounced and provide real-time parts filtering
10. Form validation must work correctly with the new autocomplete parts selection

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.2:
- Successfully enhanced Sales module analytics with date filtering pattern ("All time", "Today", "Last 7 Days", "Last 1 Month")
- Pattern of creating analytics cards and integrating date range filtering works well
- Backend tRPC procedure enhancement pattern for analytics data established
- Frontend component patterns for responsive analytics cards proven effective
- ProductAutocomplete component created - can be used as pattern for parts autocomplete
- Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting patterns already established
- Implementation proceeded smoothly following established patterns

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Repairs analytics will use existing models (Repairs, Products for parts tracking) to calculate and display new metrics. All calculations are derived from existing database tables without schema changes. Autocomplete search will use existing Product model data for parts selection. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no repair-specific schema changes specified]

### API Specifications  
No new API endpoints required at the REST level. Repairs enhancements will extend existing tRPC procedures to provide additional analytics data and date filtering capabilities. The existing repairs tRPC router will be enhanced with:
- Date range filtering parameters for existing analytics procedures
- New procedure for Total Parts Cost calculations
- Enhanced parts search capabilities for autocomplete functionality
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - no new REST endpoints specified for repairs analytics]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**Existing Components to Modify:**
- `/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` - Add date range filter, new analytics card, and convert parts selection to autocomplete

**New Components Pattern:**
- Follow existing analytics card pattern from current Repairs page
- Use established SearchInput component pattern from `/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` for autocomplete functionality (created in Story 2.2)
- Apply date range filtering pattern similar to Sales implementation (Story 2.2)
- Use ProductAutocomplete component pattern from Story 2.2 as reference for parts autocomplete

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use existing SearchInput component with debouncing (300ms default) for autocomplete
- Apply existing analytics card styling patterns for consistency
- Ensure responsive design using existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- Convert existing parts selection to SearchInput-based autocomplete for parts selection

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- Primary file to modify: `src/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` (add date filter, new card, autocomplete)
- Autocomplete search: Use existing `/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` component
- Analytics pattern: Follow existing card pattern in Repairs page
- API enhancement: `src/server/api/routers/repair.ts` (add date filtering and new analytics procedures)
- Reference pattern: `src/components/ui/ProductAutocomplete.tsx` from Story 2.2 for parts autocomplete implementation

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New analytics card component and autocomplete functionality using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library (established pattern)
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, data rendering, and user interactions
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test analytics card renders correctly with filtered data
  - Test autocomplete search functionality with parts filtering and debouncing
  - Test date range filter integration with analytics cards
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Test form validation with new autocomplete parts selection
  - Regression testing to ensure existing repairs functionality remains intact

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **Existing Dependencies**: Use established SearchInput component and react-number-format ^5.3.4 for currency inputs
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC)
- Follow existing component patterns from current Repairs page
- Maintain consistency with existing analytics card styling
- Currency formatting must use Thai Baht (฿) symbols (existing FR15 compliance)
- Components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- **Debouncing**: SearchInput component provides 300ms debouncing for autocomplete
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient database queries with proper date filtering and indexing

### Project Structure Notes
This enhancement aligns with the existing project structure and follows the established pattern of extending existing pages with new functionality. The Repairs page enhancement will leverage existing UI components (SearchInput, analytics cards) and extend existing tRPC procedures rather than creating entirely new structure. All new functionality will integrate into the existing `/app/(main)/repairs/page.tsx` without requiring major architectural changes. Reference implementation patterns from Story 2.2 (Sales module enhancements) for consistency.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Co-located test files following established patterns
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on new analytics card and autocomplete functionality
- **Manual Testing**: Full regression test to ensure repairs enhancements don't break existing functionality
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test analytics card with various date range filters
  - Test autocomplete search with different parts scenarios
  - Test responsive design across mobile and desktop
  - Test loading states and error handling
  - Test Thai Baht currency formatting in new components
  - Test form submission with autocomplete parts selection
  - Test existing repairs table and search functionality remains intact
