# Story 2.4: Enhance Stock & Customer Modules

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** admin,
**I want** the Stock and Customer modules to provide more context (product counts) and better analytics,
**so that** I can manage my inventory and customer data more efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove the "Quick Actions" section from the Stock module UI (FR4)
2. Ensure the "Total Value" card accurately calculates and displays the total value of all products in stock (FR5)
3. The "Products" column in the `Categories` table must display the count of products within that category (FR6)
4. The "Products" column in the `Units` table must display the count of products using that unit (FR7)
5. Add two new analytics cards to the Customer module: "Total Customers" and "New Customers (This Month)" (FR21)
6. Maintain existing functionality in both Stock and Customer modules
7. Ensure all currency values display in Thai Baht (฿) format (existing FR2 compliance)
8. Add proper loading states and error handling for all new components
9. Ensure responsive design works on mobile and desktop

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3:
- Analytics card patterns are well-established and consistently implemented
- Thai Baht (฿) currency formatting patterns already established and working
- tRPC procedure enhancement pattern for analytics data proven effective
- Frontend component patterns for responsive analytics cards established
- Build and lint processes established and working correctly
- Pattern of extending existing pages with new functionality works well
- SearchInput and CurrencyInput components are available and tested

### Data Models
No new data models required for this story. Stock and Customer enhancements will use existing models (Categories, Units, Products, Customers) to calculate and display new metrics. All calculations are derived from existing database tables without schema changes. Product counts will be calculated using existing relationships in the database schema. [Source: architecture/3-data-models-and-schema-changes.md - no stock or customer-specific schema changes specified]

### API Specifications  
No new API endpoints required at the REST level. Stock and Customer enhancements will extend existing tRPC procedures to provide additional analytics data and count calculations. The existing stock and customer tRPC routers will be enhanced with:
- Product count calculation procedures for Categories and Units tables
- Enhanced Total Value calculation procedures for stock analytics
- New customer analytics procedures for Total Customers and New Customers (This Month) calculations
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md - no new REST endpoints specified for stock and customer analytics]

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-component-api-architecture.md and architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]

**Existing Components to Modify:**
- `/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` - Remove Quick Actions section, enhance Total Value card, add product counts to Categories/Units tables
- `/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` - Add new analytics cards for Total Customers and New Customers (This Month)

**Component Patterns:**
- Follow existing analytics card pattern from current Customer page and previous stories (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Use established component styling patterns for consistency
- Apply existing table enhancement patterns for Categories and Units product counts
- Use existing currency formatting patterns for Thai Baht (฿) display

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use existing analytics card styling patterns for consistency
- Ensure responsive design using existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- Apply existing loading state patterns for new components
- Follow established error handling patterns

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/5-source-tree-integration.md]
- Primary files to modify: `src/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` (remove Quick Actions, enhance table, fix Total Value card), `src/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` (add new analytics cards)
- Analytics pattern: Follow existing card patterns from previous stories and current module pages
- API enhancement: `src/server/api/routers/stock.ts` and `src/server/api/routers/customer.ts` (add count calculations and new analytics procedures)
- Table enhancement: Follow existing table patterns in Stock page for Categories and Units tables
- Testing files: Co-located test files following established patterns

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: New analytics card components and enhanced table functionality using Jest and React Testing Library
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library (established pattern)
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on component behavior, data rendering, and user interactions
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test new Customer analytics cards render correctly with data
  - Test product count calculations in Categories and Units tables
  - Test Total Value card calculations and currency formatting
  - Test Quick Actions section removal doesn't break existing functionality
  - Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Regression testing to ensure existing Stock and Customer functionality remains intact

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/2-tech-stack-alignment.md]
- **Existing Dependencies**: Use existing UI components and react-number-format ^5.3.4 for currency inputs
- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, tRPC)
- Follow existing component patterns from current Stock and Customer pages
- Maintain consistency with existing analytics card styling from previous stories
- Currency formatting must use Thai Baht (฿) symbols (existing FR2 compliance)
- Components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient database queries with proper indexing for count calculations

### Project Structure Notes
This enhancement aligns with the existing project structure and follows the established pattern of extending existing pages with new functionality. The Stock and Customer page enhancements will leverage existing UI components and extend existing tRPC procedures rather than creating entirely new structure. All new functionality will integrate into existing `/app/(main)/stock/page.tsx` and `/app/(main)/customers/page.tsx` without requiring major architectural changes. Reference implementation patterns from Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 for consistency.

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/6-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test Location**: Co-located test files following established patterns
- **Testing Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on new analytics cards, product count functionality, and Total Value enhancements
- **Manual Testing**: Full regression test to ensure Stock and Customer enhancements don't break existing functionality
